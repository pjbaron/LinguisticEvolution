This proposition proposes that asymmetric weight initialization creates functionally specialized pathways in neural networks enhancing anomaly detection by exploiting gradient-based optimization dynamics. Initializing network branches with distinct weight distributions causes them to follow divergent optimization trajectories where conservatively initialized branches converge toward stable representations of normal behavior while aggressively initialized branches maintain sensitivity to rare deviations. This dual-pathway architecture resolves fundamental tension between stability and sensitivity achieving both simultaneously through strategic initialization rather than architectural complexity or loss function modification.
