This proposition describes how radical democratic movements face "participatory capture" where institutional engagement systematically transforms them from agents of system change into instruments of system preservation. This transformation operates through material dependence on institutional resources, adoption of hierarchical forms mirroring bureaucratic structures, and concentration of power among a professional activist class that transmits institutional logic. However, movements understanding these dynamics can develop "strategic ambidexterity" maintaining dual organizational structures separating institutional engagement from transformative capacity.
