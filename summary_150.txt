This proposition describes drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy affecting 30% of patients, with Quamash-derived alkaloids representing promising precision medicine strategy through selective modulation of GABA receptor subtypes enriched in epileptogenic zones. Unlike broad-spectrum anticonvulsants suppressing neural activity globally, these alkaloids specifically target both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA receptors restoring excitatory-inhibitory balance within pathological circuits while sparing physiological networks. The alkaloids' mechanism exploits key vulnerability in epileptogenic tissue: altered GABA receptor subunit composition emerging during epileptogenesis, preferentially enhancing inhibition where specific receptor subtypes predominate.
