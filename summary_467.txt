The orthogonal group (special matrices in linear algebra) consists of two completely separate components—rotations and reflections—with determinant values of +1 and -1 respectively. Since the determinant function is continuous and can only take these two discrete values, no continuous path can connect rotations to reflections. This illustrates how local smooth behavior can coexist with global topological separation in mathematical structures.
