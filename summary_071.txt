This proposition describes how Proto-Altaic systematically encoded evidentiality through consonant alternations in three-argument verbs, creating a system where direct evidence aligned with proximal deixis, inferential evidence with medial deixis, and reportative evidence with distal deixis. This morphophonological integration reveals that evidential categories were conceptually anchored to spatial-temporal experience through concrete spatial metaphors with obligatory morphological marking. The preservation across geographically dispersed Altaic languages demonstrates cognitive entrenchment of spatial-epistemic mappings, providing empirical support for embodied cognition frameworks.
