This proposition argues that medical researchers studying cannabidiol face critical methodological bias systematically excluding gradual therapeutic improvements through analytical frameworks designed for acute interventions. When researchers apply methods optimized for dramatic short-term effects to compounds working through gradual neurochemical modulation, they generate false negatives denying patients access to beneficial treatments. Ethical research practice demands analytical methods align with temporal dynamics of interventions studied, employing longitudinal analyses capable of distinguishing meaningful therapeutic trends from statistical noise.
