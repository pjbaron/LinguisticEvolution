Scientific vocabulary keeps complicated word structures (like "microsporangium") because each part of the word carries specific meaning that helps scientists communicate precisely. While everyday language tends to simplify words over time for ease of speaking, scientific terms resist this simplification because maintaining their complex structure helps preserve their exact meaning. This shows that scientific language evolves under different pressures than everyday speech—precision matters more than convenience in science.
