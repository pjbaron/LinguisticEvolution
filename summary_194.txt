This proposition argues that reality exhibits fundamental relational structure where individual entities and collective wholes mutually constitute each other through dynamic processes of participation. Individual beings achieve their fullest existence through authentic engagement with larger wholes while these emergent collectives derive their reality from genuine participation of distinct individuals, revealing metaphysical individualism and holism as complementary dimensions of single ontological structure. Ontological priority belongs neither to parts nor wholes but to relational processes simultaneously individuating entities and integrating them into larger unities.
