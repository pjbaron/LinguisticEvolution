Sleep serves multiple functions including memory consolidation, metabolic regulation, and clearing metabolic waste from the brain through the glymphatic system. Different sleep stages (REM, light sleep, deep sleep) appear to serve distinct functions, with deep sleep particularly important for clearing protein aggregates linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding these stage-specific functions could enable targeted sleep interventions to prevent cognitive decline and optimize cognitive performance.
