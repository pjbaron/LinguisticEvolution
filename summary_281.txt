In post-industrial societies, the decline of traditional religious authority has created a crisis where communities construct competing ideological frameworks that function as quasi-religious systems with transcendent narratives and moral imperatives.

Post-industrial democracies face the unprecedented challenge of maintaining social cooperation when the frameworks themselves become objects of quasi-religious devotion and conflict.
