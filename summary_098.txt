This proposition describes how Proto-Indo-European speakers developed systematic euphemistic strategy based on morphological truncation—creating abbreviated forms of taboo words rather than replacing them with entirely different lexical items. Comparative reconstruction demonstrates these structurally incomplete forms served as primary mechanism for avoiding direct reference to bodily functions and sensitive concepts, exploiting semantic ambiguity inherent in incomplete morphological forms. This truncation strategy preserved morphological and phonological connections to original terms allowing gradual semantic bleaching rather than abrupt replacement.
