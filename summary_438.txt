Flow chemistry conducts reactions in continuously flowing streams rather than batch vessels, enabling better heat and mass transfer, precise residence time control, and safer handling of hazardous intermediates. This approach facilitates reactions difficult in batch mode and enables real-time optimization and process intensification. Flow chemistry is increasingly adopted in pharmaceutical manufacturing.
