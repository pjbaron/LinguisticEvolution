Shape-memory alloys undergo reversible phase transformations enabling them to "remember" and return to original shapes after deformation when heated. Applications exploit this behavior for actuators, medical stents, and adaptive structures. Understanding the martensitic transformation mechanisms enables engineering alloys with specific transformation temperatures and mechanical properties.
