This proposition describes neuropsychological research revealing temporal and spatial cognition are coupled through shared executive control mechanisms, particularly working memory updating and cognitive flexibility networks. Individuals with rigid temporal processing—impaired ability to flexibly sequence and organize time-related information—consistently demonstrate reduced spatial reasoning when tasks require dynamic mental manipulation of three-dimensional relationships. This coupling appears reliably across clinical populations including traumatic brain injury, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorders, indicating temporal processing rigidity may serve as early marker of executive dysfunction preceding deficits observable on conventional spatial assessments.
