This proposition describes Grizel, a methylated quinazoline derivative with selective COX-2 inhibitory activity representing promising therapeutic approach for laryngovestibulitis through targeted local delivery maximizing anti-inflammatory efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity. The compound's enhanced lipophilicity facilitates superior tissue penetration in inflamed upper respiratory tissues but creates critical pharmacokinetic challenge: achieving therapeutic local concentrations without systemic exposure increasing cardiovascular risk. This narrow therapeutic window necessitates topical or inhaled formulations maximizing local bioavailability while limiting systemic absorption, potentially achieving site-specific COX-2 inhibition without reaching plasma concentrations associated with cardiovascular toxicity.
