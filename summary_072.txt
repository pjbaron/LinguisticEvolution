This proposition proposes that distributed aquaculture monitoring systems should use contextual compression that dynamically allocates data fidelity based on criticality rather than uniform policies. Parameters approaching thresholds, exhibiting unusual variance, or matching historical failure patterns receive high-fidelity preservation, while stable measurements undergo aggressive compression. This approach requires predictive models identifying parameter combinations most indicative of emerging problems, adaptive rolling windows maintaining high-fidelity data during anomalies, and temporal correlation analysis recognizing when stable parameters may precede critical events.
