DNA nanotechnology exploits Watson-Crick base pairing to create programmable molecular structures and devices with nanometer-scale precision. By designing DNA sequences that fold into desired shapes or assemble into larger structures, researchers create templates for organizing other materials, drug delivery vehicles, and molecular machines. This bottom-up approach enables unprecedented control over nanoscale architecture.
