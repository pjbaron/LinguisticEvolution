This proposition describes how medieval South Asian coastal communities developed sophisticated knowledge systems to neutralize marine biotoxins from recurring dinoflagellate blooms. These detoxification practices were transmitted through kinship networks and occupational guilds, creating regionally distinct ethnobotanical traditions corresponding to local bloom patterns and available plant resources. The remarkable specificity featuring toxin-targeted preparations rather than generalized remedies demonstrates how predictable environmental hazards drive evolution of precisely calibrated cultural knowledge through iterative testing across generations.
