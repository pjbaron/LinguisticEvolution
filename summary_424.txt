Self-supervised learning trains models on unlabeled data by predicting parts of inputs from other parts, learning useful representations without expensive human annotation. Techniques like masked language modeling or contrastive learning have enabled models to learn from massive datasets. This approach dramatically reduces annotation requirements while achieving state-of-the-art performance.
