Market downturns create conditions for permanent oligopolistic concentration through a predictable pattern: financially strong firms buy distressed competitors at discounts while regulatory attention focuses on economic recovery rather than market structure. The most critical period for preserving competition occurs during early recovery when consolidation accelerates but political pressure to maintain competitive markets is weakest. This pro-cyclical nature of antitrust enforcement systematically favors market concentration over time.
