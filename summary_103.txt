This proposition describes how benthic cnidarians have evolved specialized ciliary cells within their gastrovascular cavity undergoing rapid chromatic changes synchronized with digestive cycles. During prey processing, chromophore-containing organelles redistribute in response to digestive metabolites and pH fluctuations, creating dynamic color shifts optimizing light penetration precisely when zooxanthellae symbionts require enhanced photosynthetic capacity. This chromatic-digestive coupling represents advanced energy management coordinating heterotrophic and autotrophic processes through temporal metabolic switching, enabling rapid transitions between digestive enzyme production and symbiont metabolic support.
