This proposition argues that aesthetic value emerges from dynamic tension between order and chaos—principle most clearly visible in living systems where natural forms derive compelling beauty from "organized irregularity" like asymmetrical tree branching or irregular mycelia networks. The most profound aesthetic encounters occur at critical thresholds where organizational principles meet their limits and established structure begins dissolving into new possibility, with these moments of creative instability generating forms neither pure order nor pure chaos could produce alone. This biological aesthetic is inherently processual existing in continuous negotiation between stability and change rather than seeking timeless perfection.
