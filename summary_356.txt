Hierarchical porous materials with pores at multiple size scales (micropores, mesopores, macropores) enable efficient mass transport while maintaining high surface area. By engineering connectivity between different pore levels, materials scientists can optimize simultaneous diffusion and adsorption for applications like catalysis and separations. Achieving precise control over hierarchical structure requires advanced synthesis techniques combining different templating and assembly strategies.
