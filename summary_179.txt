This proposition identifies fundamental epistemological tension in embodied cognition theories: if knowledge acquisition depends on integrating cognitive processing with bodily experience, then motor impairments don't represent cognitive deficits but alternative pathways to knowledge potentially revealing reality aspects obscured by normative embodied experience. Conventional knowledge validation methods designed around normative experiences systematically exclude cognitive contributions from individuals with motor impairments, yet these alternative embodied experiences constitute forms of expertise potentially providing privileged epistemic access to domains like environmental accessibility or spatial navigation under constraint generating insights unavailable through normative embodiment.
