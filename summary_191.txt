This proposition argues that formal systems combining non-monotonic inference with modal operators face inherent stability problem where defeasible rules can generate oscillating truth values violating modal consistency requirements. The instability arises from fundamental architectural conflict where non-monotonic reasoning allows new premises to invalidate previously derived conclusions while modal semantics demands stable truth conditions across possible worlds. When these requirements interact, systems can enter infinite loops where modal formulas alternate between contradictory truth values creating cycles preventing stable truth assignments.
