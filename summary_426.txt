Piezoelectric materials generate electric charge in response to mechanical stress and deform when voltage is applied, enabling sensors, actuators, and energy harvesting. Performance depends on the piezoelectric coefficient linking mechanical and electrical responses. Applications range from ultrasound transducers to vibration energy harvesters converting ambient mechanical energy to electricity.
