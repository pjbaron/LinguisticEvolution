Post-colonial textile artists use ramie fiber because its physical properties mirror their conceptual concerns—ramie inherently resists uniform dyeing, creating irregular patterns despite attempts at standardization. This material resistance to homogenization operates as a direct metaphor for cultural resistance to colonial homogenization, making medium and message genuinely correspond. The fiber becomes a collaborator whose resistant responses generate visual language alongside human intention.
