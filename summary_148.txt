This proposition describes behavioral economics research revealing that consumer willingness-to-pay for "cute" design elements follows U-shaped curve across age demographics, with young and elderly consumers demonstrating significantly higher valuations while middle-aged consumers show relative indifference. The psychological mechanisms differ by age group: young consumers respond through natural affinity and identity expression, while elderly consumers' renewed preference stems from heightened emotional regulation priorities, grandparent psychology, and evolved caregiving responses reactivating during later life. This non-linear preference structure creates market opportunities for age-targeted pricing strategies and variant portfolios.
