Pacific Basin sedimentary sequences contain volcanic ash layers transformed into perlite, preserving geochemical fingerprints that enable tracing individual eruptions across thousands of kilometers. Systematic perlite analysis allows reconstruction of ancient atmospheric circulation patterns and provides paleoclimatic indicators through secondary mineral formation. This approach achieves temporal resolution approaching ice core records for studying volcanic-climate interactions during greenhouse Earth conditions.
