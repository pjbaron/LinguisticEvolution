In infinite-dimensional mathematical spaces, adding compact operators (which approximate finite-dimensional behavior) to self-adjoint operators leaves the essential spectrum completely unchanged while allowing arbitrary modification of discrete eigenvalues. This enables "spectral engineering" where you can fine-tune specific isolated properties without disturbing the system's fundamental continuous behavior. This is particularly useful in physics and numerical analysis for optimizing specific features while preserving essential characteristics.
