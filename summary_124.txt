This proposition argues that aesthetic power emerges most forcefully at the intersection of perfection and its dissolution, as classical marble sculptures achieve their most compelling presence through time's interventions like mineral stains and fractures rather than pristine idealization. These disruptions create visual tension that pure perfection cannot generate, revealing how aesthetic intensity depends on visible collision between order and entropy. This dynamic transcends historical periods as contemporary artists exploit similar tensions through decay, glitch aesthetics, and controlled destruction, suggesting profound visual experience requires opposition rather than resolution.
