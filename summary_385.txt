Morphology—word structure and formation processes—varies dramatically across languages from isolating (minimal inflection) to polysynthetic (complex word-internal structure). Understanding morphological diversity reveals the range of strategies languages use to encode grammatical information and create new words. Cross-linguistic patterns constrain theories of possible human languages and universal grammar.
