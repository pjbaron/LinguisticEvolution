This proposition describes how statistical discrimination against women arises from information asymmetries in labor markets where employers unable to predict which individual women will interrupt careers apply group-based probabilities to all women of reproductive age, systematically discounting wages and advancement regardless of individual productivity. This creates self-reinforcing equilibrium through three mechanisms: women rationally reduce educational investments anticipating lower returns, these responses validate employers' statistical assumptions making discrimination appear economically justified, and women concentrate in occupations where career interruptions carry smaller penalties deepening occupational segregation.
