Workers who regularly breathe metal particles (like blacksmiths and metalworkers) accumulate iron and copper in their respiratory tracts, which triggers chemical reactions that damage the mucus proteins lining their airways. These damaged proteins change the physical properties of mucus, which alters airflow patterns and sound resonance during speaking, producing measurable changes in voice quality. Analyzing voice characteristics could provide a simple, non-invasive way to detect early metal exposure in at-risk workers before traditional symptoms appear.
