In planetary atmospheres with vertical metallicity gradients (where metal content varies with altitude), the wavelength-dependent opacity creates complex heating patterns that fundamentally alter atmospheric structure and climate. For planets orbiting K-type stars, this effect is especially strong because the star's infrared-heavy light overlaps with absorption bands of metal-bearing molecules, concentrating heat at specific depths. This mechanism can create climate bistability zones where small compositional changes trigger rapid transitions between temperate and runaway greenhouse conditions, making atmospheric evolution as important as orbital distance for determining habitability.
