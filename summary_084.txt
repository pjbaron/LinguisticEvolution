This proposition describes exceptional preservation of Utricularia microfossils in Miocene lake sediments occurring within clay-rich intervals containing abundant detrital magnetite, providing diagnostic signatures for closed-basin conditions. During basin closure, evaporation-driven salinity increases triggered enhanced clay mineral precipitation creating protective microenvironments while elevated ionic strength inhibited bacterial decomposition. The magnetic mineral assemblages preserve high-resolution paleomagnetic records enabling precise temporal correlation between geographically separated lake systems.
