This proposition argues that counterterror reasoning requires probabilistic rather than binary logic because threats exist along continuous spectra of likelihood rather than as certain facts. Classical logic's excluded middle principle proves inadequate when security decisions must account for graduated threat probabilities and dynamic risk thresholds, particularly given threat interdependence creating cascading uncertainty. Effective counterterror logic must employ Bayesian frameworks continuously updating probability distributions as intelligence emerges, optimizing decision quality by recalibrating action thresholds against evolving probability ranges.
