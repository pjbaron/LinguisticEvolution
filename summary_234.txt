This proposition suggests that ancient populations who regularly consumed psychoactive plants developed genetic variations in their ability to metabolize these compounds, creating different cultural trajectories. Fast metabolizers developed sophisticated botanical knowledge and ritual technologies for preparing plant medicines, while populations with slower metabolism innovated alternative methods for altered consciousness like rhythmic practices, controlled breathing, and architectural features designed for sensory manipulation. Testing this theory requires comparing genetic markers for drug metabolism with archaeological distributions of ritual technologies across prehistoric populations.
