Ancient monumental architecture often incorporates astronomical alignments to solstices, equinoxes, or significant stellar events, revealing sophisticated understanding of celestial mechanics. These alignments served practical calendrical functions for agricultural societies while also encoding cosmological worldviews in built space. Analyzing architectural orientations across cultures reveals both universal astronomical observations and culturally-specific interpretations of celestial phenomena.
