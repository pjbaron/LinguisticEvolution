This proposition demonstrates through Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology that pathological conditions fundamentally disrupt the pre-reflective intentional arc between body and world, revealing embodiment's constitutive role in consciousness through its breakdown. In healthy embodiment, the lived-body schema operates as transparent medium of world-disclosure, but pathological conditions shatter this transparency by thrusting the body into compulsive thematic awareness. This disruption extends into the intersubjective realm through intercorporeality's deterioration, precipitating social withdrawal as embodied transparency's breakdown generates double alienation from world and others.
