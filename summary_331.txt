Glacial-interglacial cycles over the past million years have created recurring patterns of species range shifts, population bottlenecks, and isolation that shaped genetic diversity in modern species. By analyzing DNA from modern populations and ancient specimens, researchers can reconstruct how climate oscillations drove evolutionary processes including speciation, adaptation, and extinction. Understanding these historical patterns helps predict how current climate change might affect biodiversity and evolution.
