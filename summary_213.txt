During the Messinian Salinity Crisis (about 6 million years ago), the Mediterranean Sea repeatedly dried up, creating extreme salt deposits and changing what organisms could survive in that region. The complex patterns of evaporites (mineral deposits from evaporated water) and their chemical signatures can tell us about rapid climate changes, orbital forcing patterns (how Earth's orbit affects climate), and connections between the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean. By studying these deposits with modern geochemical techniques, scientists can better understand how extreme climate events affect ocean circulation and regional ecosystems.
