The traditional moral hierarchy placing humans above animals is challenged when we recognize that many animals demonstrate behaviors we consider morally significant, like cooperation, care for others, and emotional bonds. If we base moral status on demonstrated capacities rather than species membership, we must either expand our moral circle to include cognitively sophisticated animals or admit that our current ethical frameworks contain contradictions. The framework of "graduated moral consideration" would grant different levels of moral status based on demonstrated cognitive and emotional capacities rather than species boundaries.
