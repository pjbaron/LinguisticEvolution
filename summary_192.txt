This proposition argues that traditional knowledge systems often achieve superior epistemic reliability compared to individual observation through distributed empirical testing across extended timescales. Inherited wisdom represents accumulated observations where time functions as rigorous filter: insights repeatedly proving valuable persist and strengthen while errors gradually fade from transmission, revealing patterns and causal relationships invisible to individual observers constrained by limited timeframes. This reveals counterintuitive epistemic principle where distance from immediate experience can provide more reliable access to truth than proximity to it.
