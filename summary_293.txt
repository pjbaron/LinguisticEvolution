Occupational inhalation of metal particles deposits transition metals in respiratory tracts that catalyze reactions generating reactive oxygen species, which oxidize mucin glycoproteins and alter mucus viscoelasticity. These rheological changes modify airflow dynamics during phonation, affecting voice quality in measurable ways. Acoustic analysis could serve as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection of respiratory metal accumulation in at-risk populations.
