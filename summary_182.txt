This proposition describes how during hippocampal memory consolidation, glial cells undergo experience-dependent morphological remodeling creating specialized microenvironments around strengthening synapses, positioning metabolic support and neurotransmitter clearance machinery with spatial precision at sites of enhanced plasticity. This glial restructuring exhibits distinctive temporal profile: dynamic during memory formation then stabilizing to maintain established connectivity patterns, with rapid remodeling occurring on timescales comparable to behavioral adaptation. Rather than passively responding to neuronal activity, glia actively sculpt synaptic networks through targeted architectural changes persisting long after initial learning.
