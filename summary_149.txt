This proposition describes how pre-Columbian Andean societies developed dual-visibility system in mortuary contexts encoding social information at multiple access levels through strategic use of photoluminescent minerals. Unlike conventional grave goods visible to all observers, these minerals revealed additional kinship and hierarchical data only when activated under specific lighting conditions by ritual specialists possessing requisite technical knowledge. This system functioned as chemical cryptography embedding encoded social information directly into burial architecture through selective mineral placement, creating simultaneous information channels with public displays and restricted data visible only to initiated practitioners.
