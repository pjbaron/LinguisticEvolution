Enzymatic catalysis achieves remarkable rate accelerations and selectivity by precisely positioning reactants, stabilizing transition states, and creating specialized microenvironments within active sites. Designing artificial enzymes (protein engineering or de novo design) requires understanding and recreating these features through computational modeling and directed evolution. Success could enable sustainable chemical manufacturing by replacing harsh industrial processes with mild biocatalytic alternatives.
