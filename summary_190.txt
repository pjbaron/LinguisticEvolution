This proposition argues that when fundamentally incompatible ontological frameworks encounter one another, rational mediation reaches its limits where in cases of genuine incommensurability the most rigorous epistemic stance is sustained categorical suspension—deliberate withholding of judgment preserving each worldview's integrity without forcing artificial synthesis. This position avoids two philosophical errors: reducing genuine differences to superficial disagreements dissolving through clarification, and dismissing competing truth claims without adequate engagement. Such suspension constitutes active philosophical work requiring continuous engagement with each framework on its own terms and sustained attention to precise nature of their incompatibility.
