Consciousness experiences a fundamental tension between wanting to be a unified self and the reality that different aspects of experience (bodily sensations, emotions, thoughts) operate on incompatible timescales and resist integration. This fragmentation isn't a failure of consciousness but reveals the inherent limits of trying to unify fundamentally different types of experience. We are conscious precisely because of this unresolvable tension between unity and multiplicity, not despite it.
