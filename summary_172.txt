This proposition describes how nature-based contemplative practices produce distinct neural plasticity changes enhancing stress resilience through two complementary mechanisms: strengthened connectivity between prefrontal regulatory regions and limbic circuits creating more adaptive stress responses, and enhanced parasympathetic activation reducing physiological reactivity combined with decreased default mode network activity minimizing maladaptive rumination. The natural environment functions as active neuroplastic catalyst rather than passive context, with biophilic sensory input combined with focused attention engaging evolutionary-conserved stress recovery circuits potentially explaining superior long-term resilience outcomes compared to laboratory-based meditation.
