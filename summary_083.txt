This proposition argues that distributed hash tables fail when nodes make locally optimal peer selection decisions creating globally suboptimal network topologies. When nodes prioritize immediate connectivity metrics like latency, they form clustered networks where traffic concentrates on well-connected nodes, creating persistent bottlenecks. The solution requires treating peer selection and routing maintenance as coupled optimization problems prioritizing global network health over local node performance through algorithms incorporating topological diversity and real-time node capacity.
