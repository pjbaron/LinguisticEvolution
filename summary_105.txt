This proposition describes how synaptic vesicle membrane instability in prefrontal cortex neurons disrupts temporal precision of neurotransmitter release, introducing stochastic variability impairing executive functions. This presynaptic dysfunction arises from altered membrane biophysics compromising calcium sensitivity and fusion kinetics, with probabilistic degradation compounding across dense prefrontal synaptic connections creating cascade failures in cognitive processing. Membrane instability also disrupts vesicle recycling creating activity-dependent deterioration where high-frequency firing progressively degrades synaptic reliability, explaining why executive deficits worsen under cognitive load.
