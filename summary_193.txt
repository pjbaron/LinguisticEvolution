This proposition argues that the Oresteia reveals political legitimacy emerges not by eliminating violence but by monopolizing it within state institutions, with Aeschylus demonstrating transformation from private vengeance to public justice preserves retributive logic it claims to transcend. The Furies' integration into Athenian law shows how political order achieves stability by channeling vengeful impulses through institutional forms rather than abolishing them, exposing political legitimacy as constitutively paradoxical. The state's punitive apparatus mirrors private revenge it replaces where legal systems systematize cycles of retribution rather than overcome them.
