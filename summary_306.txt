Racial bias can become biologically embedded through a feedback loop: when people encounter racially ambiguous faces, biased brain processing triggers stress hormones, which then strengthen categorical thinking about race. This stress response makes the brain pay more attention to racial categories and reduces empathy for out-group members, deepening the original bias. The cycle repeats and strengthens over time, transforming cognitive biases into stable neurobiological patterns that operate automatically and resist conscious intervention.
