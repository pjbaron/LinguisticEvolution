Palomino coat color in horses results from elongated structures in hair follicles that create spatial zones where different pigments are produced, rather than from uniform dilution of pigment throughout the hair. The timing of when these elongated structures form relative to pigment-producing cell migration is critical for establishing the golden phenotype. This developmental mechanism could explain other selective dilution patterns across mammalian species and suggests that follicle architecture is a key developmental module for generating coat color diversity.
