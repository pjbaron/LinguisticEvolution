This proposition describes how mechanical percussion therapy enhances lymphatic drainage by delivering targeted stimulation at 20-40 Hz frequencies generating rhythmic pressure waves increasing lymphatic transport velocity by 40-60% and reducing interstitial fluid accumulation. The mechanism operates through direct compression of lymphatic capillaries enhancing fluid uptake and mechanical stimulation triggering coordinated smooth muscle contractions activating the intrinsic lymphatic pump. Therapeutic efficacy requires precise force calibration within narrow window as insufficient force fails to generate adequate pressure differentials while excessive force causes vessel collapse and protective vasoconstriction paradoxically impairing drainage.
