This proposition describes how quantum decoherence in macroscopic systems exhibits mode selectivity where environmental coupling preserves coherence in specific quantum modes while rapidly thermalizing others. This selectivity arises because different modes experience distinct environmental spectral densities creating vastly different decoherence timescales within the same system, generating structured decoherence landscape where islands of quantum behavior persist within predominantly classical dynamics. By engineering environmental coupling structures, this enables creation of decoherence-resistant quantum systems operating in warm, noisy environments.
