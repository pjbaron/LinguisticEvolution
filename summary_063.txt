This proposition argues that tidal infrastructure like aboideaus achieves aesthetic excellence by orchestrating rather than opposing natural forces, creating temporal beauty through rhythmic cycles of flooding and draining. These structures function as instruments rendering visible the forces they channel, transforming utilitarian necessity into choreographed performance between human intention and natural power. This reveals that sustainable infrastructure reaches its highest aesthetic potential by celebrating dynamic relationships between built systems and living processes, where beauty lies in process made manifest.
