Empathy involves both cognitive perspective-taking (understanding what someone thinks) and affective sharing (feeling what someone feels), which recruit different neural networks and can be selectively impaired. Some individuals show high cognitive empathy but low affective empathy (understanding others without feeling their emotions), while others show the opposite pattern. Understanding this dissociation has important implications for treating conditions like psychopathy (impaired affective empathy) versus autism spectrum disorders (often impaired cognitive empathy but intact affective responses).
