Pidgins maintain greater phonological transparency than creoles due to fundamentally different communicative pressures—pidgins must maximize surface-level clarity to enable communication without shared grammatical competence. Creolization fundamentally alters these constraints as native speakers develop internalized grammatical systems that enable processing of phonologically opaque forms without comprehension loss. This evolutionary trajectory reveals that structural complexity correlates with the degree of shared linguistic competence among speakers rather than communicative sophistication per se.
