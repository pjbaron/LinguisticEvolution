Machine learning models often learn spurious correlations in training data—patterns that happen to work in the training set but don't reflect genuine causal relationships. Causal inference techniques can identify and eliminate these spurious correlations by distinguishing between mere statistical associations and actual causal mechanisms. Integrating causal reasoning into machine learning pipelines produces models that generalize better to new situations and remain robust when the statistical distribution of data changes.
