Palomino coat color in horses results from elongated structures in hair follicles that create zones where different pigments are produced rather than uniform dilution throughout the hair. The timing when these structures form relative to pigment cell migration is critical for establishing the golden color. This developmental mechanism likely extends to other coat color patterns and shows how follicle architecture can generate diverse appearances from similar genetic starting points.
