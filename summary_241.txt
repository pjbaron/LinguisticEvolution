When consciousness recognizes that mind and body are interdependent aspects of one reality rather than separate substances, embodiment becomes natural and harmonious instead of conflictual. Many difficulties traditionally attributed to material existence actually originate from dualistic thinking that creates artificial separations where none exist. Authentic spiritual development thus involves correcting these conceptual distortions rather than trying to transcend physicality.
