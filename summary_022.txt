This proposition argues that the gap between what we experience and ultimate reality isn't a limitation but the very mechanism by which infinite being creates individual consciousness. The separation between our finite awareness and absolute truth enables reality to know itself through multiple individual perspectives. Each conscious being exists as a distinct viewpoint through which the infinite experiences itself as finite, making the apparent division actually the deepest form of unity.
