This proposition identifies paradox where communities near leucaugite mining operations face elevated health risks justifying prioritized medical research funding under distributive justice principles, yet this vulnerability creates opportunities for pharmaceutical companies to extract traditional medicinal knowledge without fair compensation. This exposes critical flaw in medical research ethics where vulnerability-based research prioritization inadvertently enables exploitation by directing attention toward at-risk communities while failing to secure reciprocal benefits. Ethical consistency requires comprehensive benefit-sharing frameworks established before research begins, guaranteeing affected communities immediate healthcare provision, long-term royalty rights, and decision-making authority.
