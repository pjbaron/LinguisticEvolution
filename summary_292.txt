English compound words containing "rubble" demonstrate that phonological reduction in technical vocabulary depends on morphological transparency—compositionally clear compounds resist consonant deletion while lexicalized terms undergo simplification. This asymmetry reveals that speakers preserve morphological structure when compound meaning remains transparent but allow prosodic optimization when compounds become semantically opaque. Technical vocabulary undergoes systematic sound change along a pathway from compositional transparency to lexicalized opacity.
