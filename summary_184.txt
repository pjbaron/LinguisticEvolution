This proposition argues that encounters with uncanny phenomena reveal fundamental interdependence of consciousness and world by disrupting ordinary experience of time where confronted with strange or threatening events linear temporality fractures with past traumas resurfacing and future anxieties collapsing into overwhelming present. This temporal disruption exposes what normally remains concealed: our awareness of mortality structures all conscious engagement with reality, demonstrating consciousness does not observe external world from detached position but rather subject and object emerge together through finite death-bound existence. The uncanny thus functions as philosophical disclosure revealing that meaning itself depends on limitation we typically seek to forget or transcend.
