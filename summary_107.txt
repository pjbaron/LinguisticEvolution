This proposition argues that ethical AI deployment in African contexts requires frameworks explicitly addressing colonial legacies and power asymmetries, with African philosophical traditions like Ubuntu's relational ethics offering essential alternatives to individualistic Western frameworks. Three core principles define this approach: authentic community participation through traditional consensus-building, preventing neo-colonial extraction where benefits flow externally while communities bear risks, and strengthening indigenous governance structures through hybrid models integrating technological capabilities with traditional wisdom. Implementation requires establishing community ownership models and creating accountability mechanisms rooted in traditional justice systems.
