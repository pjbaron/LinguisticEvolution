Human language appears to have a recursive property where phrases can be embedded within phrases indefinitely (like "the cat that chased the rat that ate the cheese"), but debate exists about whether this is truly universal or culturally variable. Some linguists argue that recursion is a core feature of human language faculty hardwired in the brain, while others contend that certain languages show limited recursion and that it may be a learned cultural feature. Resolving this debate has major implications for understanding whether language is a species-specific biological adaptation or a more general cognitive capacity.
