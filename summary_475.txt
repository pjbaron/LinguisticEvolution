Sooreyn describes strategic assimilation where marginalized groups adopt visible dominant cultural practices while internally rejecting underlying values, creating performative compliance reinforcing existing hierarchies. Dominant groups interpret mimicry as validation while marginalized groups use surface adoption as protective camouflage. This creates double binds where advancement requires abandoning core identity, making remaining inequalities appear as individual failings rather than structural barriers.
