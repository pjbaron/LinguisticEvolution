This proposition describes how deep-sea cephalopods control bioluminescence through sphaeristeria—specialized organelles that modulate light output via mechanical compression rather than chemical reactions. These spherical structures contain light-producing molecules within contractile membranes that control light intensity by physically altering molecular proximity, offering rapid response times, graded control, and reduced metabolic costs compared to traditional enzymatic regulation. This mechanical system likely evolved under extreme metabolic constraints of the deep-sea environment where energy conservation directly impacts survival.
