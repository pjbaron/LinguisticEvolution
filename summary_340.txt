Housing policies that segregate populations by income create concentrated disadvantage where multiple forms of inequality (educational, health, environmental, economic) reinforce each other across generations. Breaking these cycles requires integrated interventions addressing housing, education, healthcare, and employment simultaneously rather than treating them as separate issues. Mixed-income housing policies show promise but face political resistance and implementation challenges.
