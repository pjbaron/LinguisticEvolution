The orthogonal group O(n) consists of matrices satisfying specific conditions that force determinant values of exactly +1 or -1, and since the determinant function is continuous, no continuous path can connect these two values. This topological obstruction partitions O(n) into exactly two connected components: rotations (determinant +1) and reflections (determinant -1), which cannot be continuously deformed into each other. This binary classification exemplifies how local analytical properties interact with global topological constraints.
