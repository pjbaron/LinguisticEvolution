Climate change creates asymmetric impacts where vulnerable populations bear disproportionate costs despite contributing least to emissions, raising profound justice concerns. Addressing climate justice requires mechanisms ensuring equitable burden-sharing, compensating affected communities, and giving vulnerable populations voice in climate policy. This involves both mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (helping communities cope), with special attention to historical responsibility and differential capabilities.
