Green chemistry principles aim to design chemical processes that minimize waste, use renewable feedstocks, avoid toxic substances, and maximize atom economy. Implementing these principles requires rethinking synthesis strategies, developing benign solvents and reagents, and designing for degradation. This approach makes chemistry more sustainable while often improving efficiency and safety.
