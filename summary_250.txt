Vertical metallicity gradients in exoplanetary atmospheres create wavelength-dependent opacity variations that fundamentally alter thermal structure, especially pronounced for planets orbiting K-type stars where the near-infrared stellar spectrum overlaps with metal-bearing molecular absorption bands. This metallicity-opacity coupling creates climate bistability regions where small compositional changes trigger rapid atmospheric transitions, making atmospheric chemical evolution as important as orbital distance for habitability. The mechanism explains observational puzzles in sub-Neptune atmospheric diversity and should produce distinctive signatures accessible to current spectroscopy.
