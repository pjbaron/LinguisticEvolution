Environmental inequality may perpetuate social stratification through differential access to biodiverse natural environments that influence cognitive development via the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Children from marginalized communities often lack exposure to diverse microorganisms in natural settings, potentially impairing neurological development during critical windows. This creates feedback loops where environmental deprivation reinforces communication and educational disparities across generations.
