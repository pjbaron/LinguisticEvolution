This proposition describes how digital networks have fundamentally transformed social movement mobilization by enabling decentralized peer-to-peer organizing bypassing traditional gatekeepers. Movements now spread laterally through personal networks creating simultaneous resilience and fragility: distributed structure resists suppression through targeted disruption yet generates coordination challenges and ideological drift fragmenting movements over time. Digital propagation compresses movement lifecycles dramatically where viral spread generates massive mobilization before organizational infrastructure develops, creating powerful but ephemeral collective action with broader but loosely committed constituencies.
