This proposition describes how binary pulsar systems provide stringent tests of general relativity in strong gravitational fields, with orbital decay matching Einstein's predictions to within 0.2%. As gravitational wave emission shrinks orbital separations over millions of years, the evolving tidal environment may fundamentally alter neutron star magnetospheres through crustal stress and magnetic flux redistribution. Pulsar timing arrays monitoring multiple systems access gravitational wave memory effects—permanent spacetime deformations persisting after wave passage—demonstrating how spacetime retains information about gravitational interactions.
