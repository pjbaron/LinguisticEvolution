This proposition describes how urban community gardens function as territorial resistance mechanisms where marginalized residents transform contested spaces into community-controlled territories through collective cultivation. The cultivation process builds informal networks through shared labor producing visible evidence of community presence forcing developers to acknowledge existing social fabric, establishing "productive sanctuaries" generating both economic value through food production and social value through relationship building. The territorial assertions established through gardens differ fundamentally from other organizing as they're literally rooted in place creating ongoing obligations deepening community bonds while transforming abstract boundaries into tangible defensible spaces.
