This proposition describes how extremophile bacteria exhibit paradoxical radioprotective response to plutonium exposure where, rather than causing cellular damage through typical heavy metal toxicity, plutonium binding to phosphatidylserine-rich membrane domains functions as molecular trigger activating enhanced DNA repair mechanisms and radiation resistance pathways. This phenomenon reveals evolutionary innovation where extremophiles have integrated metal detoxification and radiation defense systems into unified stress response network, with plutonium exposure serving as environmental cue priming cells for radiation damage. These findings offer new therapeutic targets for radiation exposure treatment and biological framework for engineering organisms capable of surviving extreme radioactive environments.
