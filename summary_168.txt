This proposition describes how during late-stage helium burning, massive stars undergo extreme mass loss through intensified stellar winds causing orbital expansion and potential system disruption in binary configurations. The mechanism operates through critical timescale competition where mass-loss episodes occur over timeframes comparable to or faster than orbital circularization timescales, and when mass loss rates exceed the system's capacity for orbital adjustment, binaries cannot establish new equilibrium configurations and become gravitationally unbound. Asymmetric mass ejection creates preferential momentum transfer producing runaway stars without requiring supernova explosions.
