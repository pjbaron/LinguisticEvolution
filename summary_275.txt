Sooreyn describes a paradoxical form of strategic assimilation where marginalized groups adopt visible practices of dominant culture while internally rejecting its underlying values, creating performative compliance that reinforces existing hierarchies. Dominant groups interpret cultural mimicry as validation while marginalized groups use surface-level adoption as protective camouflage, creating a double bind where advancement appears to require abandoning core identity. This invisibility allows remaining inequalities to appear as individual failings rather than structural barriers.
