This proposition argues that digital technologies have created crisis in moral authority by exposing inadequacy of traditional age-based ethical leadership where experiential wisdom without technological understanding proves insufficient for confronting algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, or AI governance decisions. The most promising solution lies in institutionalized intergenerational collaboration pairing digitally fluent individuals with experienced moral reasoners, creating more robust ethical decision-making than either group achieves independently. This requires new governance structures balancing rapid adaptation to technological change with rigorous ethical standards while preventing expertise-based authority from becoming insular through transparent validation processes.
