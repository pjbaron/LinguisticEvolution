When people feel they have no control over their circumstances, they sometimes develop a psychological state called "adaptive fatalism" where they deliberately lower their expectations and hopes to protect themselves from disappointment. This isn't clinical depression but rather a rational coping mechanism that helps people preserve their mental resources in genuinely unchangeable situations. However, this creates a dangerous trap: by reducing their sense of agency as a protective measure, people may miss actual opportunities for improvement and become stuck in circumstances they could potentially escape.
