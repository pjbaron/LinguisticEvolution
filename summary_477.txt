In high-energy plasmas, electromagnetic fields can spontaneously organize into coherent disk-like structures when particle wavelengths satisfy specific quantization conditions, creating phase coherence across macroscopic scales. These coherent modes enable ballistic energy transport preserving coherence rather than thermalizing, allowing direct electromagnetic energy extraction bypassing conventional thermal conversion. The key challenge is maintaining coherence against turbulence in high-temperature plasmas.
