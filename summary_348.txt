Single-atom catalysts disperse metal atoms individually on support materials, maximizing atom efficiency and creating uniform active sites with well-defined catalytic properties. These materials achieve remarkable activity and selectivity because every metal atom is accessible and electronically similar. Challenges include preventing atom aggregation during synthesis and operation while understanding how the local atomic environment influences catalytic performance.
