Some Eastern European nationalist movements have adopted cholent (a traditional Jewish stew) as a symbol of regional identity, creating "alimentary citizenship" where belonging comes through shared food practices rather than ethnic descent. This shows how culinary traditions can cross ethnic boundaries while maintaining cultural distinctiveness, offering a more inclusive model than ethnic nationalism. However, whether such food-based identities can withstand social crises as well as historically rooted ethnic identities remains uncertain.
