This proposition describes how platinum-based nanostructures achieve superior catalytic selectivity through electronic interactions at metal interfaces. When platinum combines with another metal, the electronic environment at their interface can selectively stabilize certain reaction pathways while destabilizing others. By tuning the strength of these electronic effects through careful choice of the second metal and interface geometry, chemists can design catalysts that direct reactions toward desired products with fine precision.
