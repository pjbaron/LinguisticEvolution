This proposition argues that mathematical rigor requires precisely defined terms within explicitly specified structures, with every meaningful statement containing well-defined objects, clearly stated operations, and claims verifiable through logical reasoning. Undefined or ambiguous terminology renders mathematical discourse meaningless, as imprecise language inevitably leads to invalid reasoning. New mathematical concepts gain legitimacy only through definition in terms of existing well-understood objects, ensuring coherent integration with established theory while preserving logical consistency.
