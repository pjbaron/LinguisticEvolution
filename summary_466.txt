Declining interfaith dialogue in democracies creates vulnerability that political elites exploit by capturing religious communities as partisan instruments, undermining both democratic accountability and religious independence. When religious traditions retreat into isolation, political actors exploit divisions to manufacture reliable voting blocs, reducing theology to electoral calculations. Interfaith dialogue should be recognized as essential democratic infrastructure preserving space for authentic religious witness.
