This proposition describes how archaeomagnetic analysis of Roman heating tiles offers unprecedented precision in dating bath complex construction by preserving magnetic signatures from original firing. These tiles record thermoremanent magnetization that can be dated using regional geomagnetic reference curves, and their magnetic orientations become permanently fixed upon installation. Magnetic signatures distinguish locally-produced tiles from transported ones, revealing whether construction followed centralized imperial supply networks or local production systems, thus illuminating imperial economic strategies and degree of local integration into Roman technological networks.
