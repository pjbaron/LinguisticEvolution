This proposition argues that the sublime aesthetic experience requires contemplative distance rather than immediate sensory immersion. The productive tension between consciousness and object creates the space where meaning unfolds through interpretive struggle, with the mind's encounter with otherness generating genuine aesthetic transformation. When theories eliminate this distance by prioritizing visceral immediacy, they reduce viewers to passive receptors rather than active interpreters, collapsing art's transformative capacity into mere physiological stimulation.
