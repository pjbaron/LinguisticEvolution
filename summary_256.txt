In monotheistic frameworks, the infinite qualitative difference between divine perfection and creaturely finitude makes moral failure structurally inevitable—sin represents not defective willing but the necessary condition of existing as a finite creature measured against absolute standards. Since finite beings cannot bridge this ontological gap through their own capacities, redemption requires fundamental transformation of the relationship between finite and infinite through divine grace. The doctrine of grace thus represents recognition of metaphysical reality—that the problem of human existence is structural rather than moral.
