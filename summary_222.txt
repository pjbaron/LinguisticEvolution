Political movements that successfully capture state power face an institutional trap: the very structures they build to secure their revolution tend to reproduce the authoritarian patterns they originally opposed. This happens because maintaining revolutionary gains requires centralized control, ideological enforcement, and suppression of threats, which eventually become permanent features rather than temporary measures. The proposition suggests pursuing social change through building alternative, decentralized structures rather than seizing centralized state power.
