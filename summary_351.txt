Subduction zones where oceanic plates descend beneath continents create distinctive magmatic arcs, deep earthquakes, and metamorphic conditions that transform descending rocks. The detailed structure of these zones—including the angle of descent, degree of coupling between plates, and fluid release patterns—controls earthquake hazards and volcanic activity. Advanced seismic imaging and geochemical analysis increasingly reveal the complex processes occurring at these critical plate boundaries.
