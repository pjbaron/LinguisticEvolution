This proposition describes machine learning system using wavelet-based spectral decomposition to extract acoustic features from bulbul bird calls for cross-species vocalization synthesis. Bulbuls produce multi-tonal calls with rapid frequency modulations spanning broad acoustic space capturing vocal patterns found across many bird species, with training exclusively on this acoustically diverse family enabling the system to learn generalizable features for high-fidelity synthesis of vocalizations from previously unseen species. This approach reduces training data requirements by order of magnitude compared to species-specific models while maintaining superior synthesis quality, though generalization depends critically on acoustic overlap between bulbul vocalizations and target species.
