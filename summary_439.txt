Critical periods in development are time windows when specific experiences have maximal impact on brain organization, after which plasticity declines. Examples include language acquisition and visual system development. Understanding critical period mechanisms involving molecular brakes on plasticity could enable therapeutic reopening for treating developmental disorders or enhancing adult learning.
