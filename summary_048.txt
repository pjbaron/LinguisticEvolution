This proposition argues that the temporal gap between touching and tasting candy reveals consciousness as fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. Unified experience requires active synthesis of separate sensory events rather than passive reception of seamless flow, suggesting our sense of living in a flowing present moment is actually successful masking of underlying temporal fragmentation. If consciousness operates through discrete moments bound into experiential wholes, then personal identity across time transforms from continuous stream persistence into dynamic pattern emerging from successful binding of discontinuous conscious moments.
