Revolutionary movements face an inherent contradiction: achieving revolutionary change requires building institutional power, but institutions tend to recreate the hierarchies and control mechanisms the revolution opposed. The protective measures used to secure gains—bureaucratic control, ideological enforcement, suppressing dissent—transform from temporary necessities into permanent features. Lasting change might require building parallel alternative structures that gradually make existing power systems obsolete rather than seizing centralized state power.
