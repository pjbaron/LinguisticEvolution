Photochemical reactions driven by light absorption can access high-energy intermediates and selectivity patterns unavailable through thermal pathways. Controlling wavelength, intensity, and reaction conditions enables precise synthetic transformations. Applications range from vitamin D synthesis to photolithography, with continued development of photoredox catalysis expanding possibilities.
