Consciousness faces a fundamental paradox: the very capacity that enables temporal experience simultaneously bars us from accessing time's essential nature. We possess immediate awareness of temporal flow yet this phenomenal temporality may bear no relation to time's mind-independent reality, as consciousness necessarily encounters time through the mediating structure of experience itself. We are condemned to be time's prisoners precisely because we are time's only witnesses—we inhabit temporality or potentially comprehend it, but never both simultaneously.
