Graph neural networks struggle with over-smoothing where node representations become increasingly similar with network depth, limiting their ability to capture complex patterns. Techniques to address this include skip connections preserving early-layer features, adaptive depth mechanisms, and decoupling representation transformation from aggregation. Solving over-smoothing could enable deeper, more expressive graph neural networks for complex relational reasoning tasks.
