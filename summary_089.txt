This proposition describes how post-industrial cities structure residential space as a three-tier density system managing class mobility while preserving stratification. Low-density suburbs house the affluent, high-density urban cores concentrate the poor, while medium-density neighborhoods serve as controlled mobility corridors processing upwardly mobile working-class families and downwardly mobile middle-class households. These intermediate zones function as residential sorting mechanisms channeling individual mobility through predictable spatial pathways that appear meritocratic while systematically reproducing segregation patterns.
