This proposition argues that universal access to life-extending technologies appears ethically mandated by principles of equality and human dignity, yet radical life extension creates fundamental moral paradox threatening the very values it seeks to protect. Near-immortal populations would accumulate resources, political influence, and social capital across centuries while successive generations face systematic disadvantage, and unlike temporary inequalities temporal inequality compounds exponentially and irreversibly. Most critically, accumulated time cannot be redistributed like wealth or education making temporal inequality uniquely pernicious, creating permanent unbridgeable gaps between individuals based solely on when they were born or gained access to life extension.
