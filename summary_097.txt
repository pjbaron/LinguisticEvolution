This proposition argues that embodied cognition reveals knowledge emerging through active bodily engagement with the world rather than passive information processing, with cognitive processes extending beyond individual minds through dynamic coupling with material and social environments. Mind and world co-constitute each other through ongoing embodied activity, dissolving traditional subject-object distinction dominating Western epistemology. This transforms knowledge from universal propositions into contextual enacted capabilities, revealing rationality itself as grounded in bodily experience and sensorimotor patterns.
