When English speakers use compound words containing "rubble," the pronunciation depends on whether they understand the word's internal structure—clear compounds like "rubble-stone-wall" preserve distinct sounds while fused words like "rubblework" simplify pronunciation. This shows that speakers preserve word structure when they can mentally break down the compound but allow sound simplification when the word has become a single fixed unit in their minds. Technical vocabulary follows a predictable path from transparent composition to opaque fusion with corresponding sound changes.
