This proposition argues that excessive self-reflection can obstruct knowledge formation by creating analytical barriers between the knower and direct experience, causing loss of access to immediate pre-reflective understanding emerging from embodied engagement with environment. Analyzing our analysis generates infinite regress moving us further from genuine insight as each additional reflection layer introduces conceptual distortions severing direct contact enabling certain forms of understanding. Different types of knowledge require fundamentally different access modes where practical wisdom, aesthetic understanding, and embodied skills degrade when subjected to excessive conceptual processing.
