Ancient trade networks left distinctive isotopic signatures in commodities like metals, textiles, and ceramics that reveal their geographic origins and movement patterns. By creating isotopic "maps" of source regions and comparing them to artifacts found at distant sites, archaeologists can trace exchange networks spanning continents and reconstruct economic relationships between ancient societies. This geochemical approach reveals trading connections that left no written records and challenges assumptions about the isolation of prehistoric communities.
