This proposition proposes mathematical models of phobic responses as trajectories in multidimensional probability spaces where each dimension corresponds to measurable anxiety parameters including physiological markers, behavioral indicators, and self-reported distress. The geometric properties of trajectory clusters enable quantification of transition probabilities between discrete anxiety states, with distance metrics between clusters correlating with therapeutic intervention success rates and cluster boundaries identifying critical thresholds where treatment approaches require modification. This transforms therapeutic intervention from reactive symptom management to proactive trajectory optimization where treatment becomes navigation problem through mathematically defined landscape.
