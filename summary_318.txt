Certain bacterial species have evolved the ability to use unusual electron acceptors (like metals or even electrodes) for respiration instead of oxygen, enabling them to generate electricity as a metabolic byproduct. Bioelectrochemical systems harness these microbes to convert organic waste directly into electrical current, providing simultaneous waste treatment and energy generation. Optimizing these systems requires understanding and engineering the electron transfer pathways between bacterial cells and electrodes at the molecular level.
