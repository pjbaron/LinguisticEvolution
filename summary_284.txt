Democratic institutions fail when political communication fragments into isolated channels separating different segments of the electorate, creating self-reinforcing feedback loops where each group receives only belief-confirming messages. This information segregation dissolves the shared epistemic foundation necessary for democratic deliberation, transforming political competition from disagreement over shared problems into conflict over the nature of reality itself. The crisis emerges endogenously from democracy's own mechanisms as responsiveness to citizen demands becomes self-defeating when those demands emerge from irreconcilable worldviews.
