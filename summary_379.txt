The prefrontal cortex supports executive functions including planning, decision-making, and impulse control, with maturation continuing into the mid-twenties. Individual differences in prefrontal function relate to self-control, academic achievement, and mental health. Understanding developmental trajectories and sources of variation could inform interventions for executive function deficits and educational approaches.
