This proposition describes how the Demodocus protein in cephalopod brains functions as a molecular memory system by converting patterns of neural activity into stable structural changes. Each neural activation makes the protein progressively more stable at the synapse through decreasing detachment probabilities, creating a ratcheting mechanism where memory strength is encoded as molecular stability. This enables individual synapses to function as autonomous memory units with intrinsic temporal integration, potentially explaining how cephalopods achieve sophisticated cognition despite having evolutionarily distinct neural architecture from mammals.
