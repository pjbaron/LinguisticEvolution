Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites can selectively adsorb specific gas molecules through coordination chemistry, enabling highly efficient separations. By tuning the metal identity, organic linker structure, and pore environment, chemists can design MOFs that preferentially capture target molecules like CO2, methane, or toxic gases. This approach could transform industrial gas separation from energy-intensive processes to efficient adsorption-based systems.
