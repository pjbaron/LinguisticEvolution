Thermoelectric materials convert temperature differences directly into electricity through the Seebeck effect, enabling waste heat recovery. Performance depends on maximizing electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while minimizing thermal conductivity—often competing requirements. Nanostructuring, complex crystal structures, and electronic band engineering offer strategies to decouple these properties and improve thermoelectric efficiency.
