This proposition addresses how maritime-dependent states must balance naval operations requiring hierarchical command with democratic governance requiring deliberation. For island nations where naval power determines survival, effective constitutional systems require specialized maritime councils combining naval professionals with civilian representatives, variable participation frameworks scaling democratic input with operational urgency, and explicit constitutional provisions balancing maritime imperatives against democratic rights. These mechanisms create hybrid legitimacy drawing from both professional competence and popular consent, treating specialized knowledge as integral to democratic decision-making.
