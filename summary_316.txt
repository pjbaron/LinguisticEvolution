Topological materials possess exotic electronic properties protected by their mathematical structure, making these properties robust against disturbances and defects. By engineering artificial structures (metamaterials) with specific geometric patterns, researchers can create materials exhibiting topological properties that don't exist in natural substances. These designer topological materials could enable fault-tolerant quantum computers, dissipationless electronics, and novel sensors by exploiting the inherent robustness of topologically protected states.
