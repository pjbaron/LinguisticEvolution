This proposition describes how fossilized neural tissue from Typotheriidae contains exceptionally preserved phospholipid bilayers with branched fatty acid chains bearing hydroxyl substituents. These hydroxyl groups form intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks between adjacent acyl chains creating cross-linked lipid matrix resisting diagenetic breakdown, representing dual-function mechanism where same chemical features providing neuroprotection against oxidative stress in living organisms also enabled superior fossilization. This suggests specialized membrane architectures incorporating hydroxylated lipids may have been more prevalent among extinct mammals than currently recognized.
