When red blood cells experience osmotic stress (imbalance in water and salt concentrations), they absorb foreign molecules until they cross a critical threshold and irreversibly transform into a different biochemical state. This demonstrates that cellular identity isn't about having specific substances but about maintaining precise molecular balances—cells are themselves only within narrow ranges. This threshold behavior reveals that biological entities exist in precarious compositional balance where small changes can trigger cascading transformations.
