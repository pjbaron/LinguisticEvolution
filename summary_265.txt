Transition metal complex crystals with irregular surfaces can be transformed into crystals with smooth, well-defined faces through controlled ligand exchange at the crystal-solution interface. This surface reconstruction exploits differences in ligand binding affinities across crystallographic planes to selectively stabilize specific crystal faces through thermodynamically favored coordination geometries. Unlike conventional recrystallization, this approach preserves bulk crystal structure while systematically engineering surface topology for catalytic applications or improved diffraction studies.
