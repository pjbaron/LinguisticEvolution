The hippocampus plays critical roles in forming new explicit memories and spatial navigation, with damage causing anterograde amnesia (inability to form new memories). The mechanisms of memory consolidation—transferring information from hippocampus to cortex for long-term storage—remain active research areas. Understanding hippocampal function has implications for treating memory disorders and age-related cognitive decline.
