Children acquire grammatical rules not just through explicit instruction but through unconscious pattern extraction from the language they hear, generating generalizations that sometimes produce creative errors like "goed" instead of "went." This process of implicit learning operates from infancy and appears to follow universal developmental trajectories across languages, suggesting specialized cognitive mechanisms for language acquisition. Understanding these mechanisms has implications for language education, particularly for second language learning and treating developmental language disorders.
