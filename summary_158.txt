This proposition describes how marginalized communities resist "temporal colonization"—systematic control of historical narrative by dominant institutions—through intergenerational transmission of cultural memories creating autonomous meaning-making systems operating in tension with official accounts. During suppression or forced assimilation, these alternative knowledge systems become vital repositories of identity surviving institutional erasure, with remembering becoming inherently political as communities preserve interpretive frameworks exposing constructed nature of dominant historical discourse. This cultural memory work is fundamentally generative rather than merely preservational, with communities continuously adapting meaning-making practices to contemporary circumstances while preserving core knowledge.
