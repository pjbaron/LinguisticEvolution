This proposition describes how in progressive metamorphic shear zones, high differential stress fundamentally accelerates metamorphic reaction kinetics by creating non-hydrostatic conditions enhancing dislocation density and grain boundary mobility. This stress-enhanced deformation enables mineral equilibration at temperatures 50-100°C lower than equivalent static metamorphism, compressing reaction timescales from millions of years to thousands. The coupling between deformation and metamorphism generates distinctive microstructural signatures quantitatively recording paleostress conditions through systematic replacement textures, crystallographic preferred orientations, and grain size distributions following stress-dependent recrystallization laws.
