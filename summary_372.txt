Batteries store energy through reversible electrochemical reactions, with performance determined by electrode materials, electrolytes, and cell architecture. Developing next-generation batteries (solid-state, lithium-sulfur, multivalent) requires materials enabling high energy density, fast charging, long cycle life, and safety. Advances in materials science and electrochemistry are essential for enabling transportation electrification and grid-scale energy storage.
