Linguistic relativity (the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis) proposes that language structure influences thought patterns and perception, with strong versions claiming language determines thought and weak versions suggesting it influences thinking. Evidence shows language does affect certain cognitive tasks (spatial reasoning, color perception, number concepts) though not in deterministic ways. Understanding these influences illuminates the complex relationship between linguistic and conceptual systems.
