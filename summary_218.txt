Specialized crystals with aligned molecular dipoles can convert temperature differences directly into electrical voltage through pyroelectric effects, offering a way to harvest energy from thermal fluctuations in the environment. By creating layered architectures where each layer responds to different temperature ranges, these materials can capture energy across wide thermal gradients more efficiently than single-phase materials. This approach could enable low-power sensors and devices that run entirely on ambient temperature variations without batteries.
