Stable isotope fractionation during biological, chemical, and physical processes creates distinctive isotopic signatures that trace environmental conditions, metabolic pathways, and source materials. Applications range from paleoclimate reconstruction using oxygen isotopes in ice cores to tracing food webs using carbon and nitrogen isotopes. These natural tracers provide powerful tools for understanding Earth and life processes.
