This proposition describes how rotating neutron stars lose angular momentum through magnetic reconnection events triggered when differential rotation between stellar surface and magnetospheric plasma exceeds critical thresholds. When magnetic field lines break co-rotation, reconnection generates helical flux tubes transporting angular momentum outward with efficiency proportional to rotation gradient, operating through discrete cycles of magnetic tension buildup and release creating quantized energy loss producing variable braking indices. As pulsars evolve from normal to millisecond regimes, magnetic field decay and period lengthening cause reconnection to become less frequent but more spatially coherent, producing fundamental transition when reconnection timescale approaches spin evolution timescale.
