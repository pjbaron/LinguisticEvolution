This proposition describes how in demographically constrained Austronesian communities, neurological conditions affecting speech production can become integrated into normative linguistic structure through systematic pathways where individuals with articulatory limitations comprise significant portion of small population. When dense social networks, minimal external linguistic contact, and founder effects amplify influence of neurologically diverse individuals, their modified speech patterns undergo social acceptance and subsequent grammaticalization transforming atypical variants into stable morphophonological features. This reveals previously underrecognized pathway of language change operating alongside conventional sound change mechanisms where individual neurological differences transform into community-wide grammatical innovations through cultural transmission.
