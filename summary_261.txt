Procedural memory formation depends on coordinated activity between visual cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, and this proposition suggests that structured visual exposure to crystalline minerals can strengthen these neural circuits. Crystals provide optimal therapeutic stimuli due to their geometric regularity, engaging pattern-processing pathways without requiring active effort or specialized equipment. Validation requires demonstrating that crystal observation increases functional connectivity in procedural learning networks and produces measurable improvements in motor sequence tasks.
