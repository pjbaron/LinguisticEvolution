This proposition describes how Austronesian ritual chants in sandstone regions have evolved specific sound patterns optimized for their geological environment. Seven-syllable chants produce resonant frequencies and harmonics precisely calibrated to exploit sandstone's acoustic properties, maximizing sound projection in natural rock amphitheaters. This demonstrates that geological acoustics can function as a selective pressure in language evolution, with phonological features emerging through feedback loops between vocal production, environmental acoustics, and ceremonial function.
