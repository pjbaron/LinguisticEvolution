This proposition argues that doctoral dissertations face a fundamental tension where comprehensive literature reviews required for credibility systematically narrow the space available for original contributions. As candidates map existing knowledge more thoroughly, they paradoxically constrain their capacity to claim genuine novelty, because transformative insights typically reframe entire domains rather than extending existing frameworks. The dissertation format institutionalizes this problem by rewarding safe positioning within well-documented debates while systematically discouraging the intellectual risk-taking that enables breakthrough thinking.
