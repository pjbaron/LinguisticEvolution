Activation-level analysis of 7B language models exposes a fundamental architectural truth: apparent "algorithmic reasoning" is pattern-matching over linguistic token distributions. Direct neural probing reveals no symbolic manipulation circuits—only hierarchical feature transformations on distributional representations. This creates a reproducible "planning-execution gap" where models decompose vague requirements into detailed plans but fail to synthesize novel algorithmic primitives outside their training distribution, blocking progress in game AI and computational science.

Current mitigation strategies—hybrid symbolic-linguistic systems, template-restricted domains, recursive planning—constitute "architectural denial": forcing reasoning capabilities onto pattern-completion substrates. We propose a practical alternative: capability-aligned development methodology.

The implementation approach: First, systematically benchmark LLMs' native computational primitives across scales (7B-405B): analogical transfer across distributional manifolds, pattern interpolation within learned representations, hierarchical linguistic transformation. Second, create a taxonomy mapping common algorithmic tasks to these primitives. Third, develop translation tools that automatically reformulate coding problems from symbolic logic into language-native operations the model naturally solves.

Concrete example: Instead of asking a 7B model to "implement Dijkstra's algorithm," decompose it into language-native operations: "describe navigation through a weighted graph as a story about choosing shortest paths" → "transform this narrative into pseudocode patterns matching training distribution examples" → "map pseudocode to syntax via learned code structure patterns." Each step exploits pattern-matching rather than fighting it.

This paradigm shift yields immediate practical value: development teams can deploy existing models more effectively by aligning problem formulation with actual model capabilities, while model developers gain empirical targets for architecture improvements grounded in real-world task decomposition.
