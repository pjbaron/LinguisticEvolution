Neural probing of 7B models reveals algorithmic reasoning is actually pattern-matching over linguistic distributions—no symbolic manipulation circuits exist, only hierarchical token transformations. This creates a "planning-execution gap": models generate detailed implementation plans but cannot synthesize novel algorithmic primitives beyond training data, critically limiting game AI and computational science applications.

Existing workarounds (hybrid symbolic systems, template restrictions, recursive planning) attempt to retrofit reasoning onto pattern-matching architectures—an architectural mismatch doomed to fail. We need capability-aligned development: systematically leveraging what LLMs actually do well.

Practical implementation framework:

**Phase 1: Capability Mapping (Weeks 1-2)**
Benchmark 7B and 405B models on standardized tasks measuring: (a) analogical transfer between code domains, (b) pattern interpolation from partial examples, (c) hierarchical code structure transformation. Output: quantitative capability profiles identifying strength/weakness boundaries.

**Phase 2: Task Taxonomy (Weeks 3-4)**
Map 100 common programming tasks to capability profiles. Categorize as: (1) directly solvable via native pattern-matching, (2) decomposable into solvable subtasks, (3) fundamentally misaligned with LLM architectures. Output: decision tree for task-model matching.

**Phase 3: Translation Tooling (Weeks 5-8)**
Build prompt engineering library that auto-reformulates type-2 tasks into chained language-native operations. Example: "implement pathfinding" → "narrate graph traversal" → "convert narrative to pseudocode template" → "map template to syntax."

**Phase 4: Validation (Weeks 9-10)**
Deploy on real projects (game NPC behavior, scientific simulation). Measure: development time, bug rates, novel problem success rate vs traditional LLM usage.

This delivers immediate ROI: developers ship faster by matching problems to model strengths, while generating empirical data to guide next-generation architecture design.
