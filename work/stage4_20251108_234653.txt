Empirical investigation of 7B language models through activation-level neural probing demonstrates that algorithmic reasoning constitutes pattern-matching over linguistic representations rather than symbolic computation—intermediate layer analysis reveals no logical inference mechanisms, only progressively abstract token transformations. This architectural constraint produces a systematic failure mode: the "planning-execution gap" where models generate syntactically coherent implementation plans yet cannot instantiate novel algorithmic components absent from training exemplars, creating critical barriers in innovation-intensive domains (game AI, scientific simulation). Conventional interventions—hybrid symbolic-linguistic systems, domain-constrained templates, hierarchical planning—represent architectural denial: attempts to impose reasoning capabilities on fundamentally pattern-completing substrates. We advance a capability-aligned alternative: comprehensive empirical mapping of LLMs' native computational primitives (analogical pattern transfer, distributional interpolation, hierarchical linguistic transformation) across the parameter spectrum (7B-405B), followed by systematic reformulation of algorithmic tasks as language-native operations. This inversion—adapting problems to match model capabilities rather than retrofitting capabilities to models—acknowledges architectural realities while maximizing practical utility of existing systems.
