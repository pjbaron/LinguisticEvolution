Neural activation analysis of 7B language models reveals that what appears as algorithmic reasoning is pattern-matching over linguistic token spaces—direct probing of intermediate computational layers shows no symbolic manipulation circuits, only hierarchical feature transformations operating on distributional representations. This architectural reality manifests as a reproducible "planning-execution gap": models reliably decompose underspecified project requirements into syntactically valid implementation plans yet systematically fail to synthesize novel algorithmic primitives when required solutions lie beyond training distribution support, creating fundamental barriers in innovation-dependent domains such as game AI and computational science. Existing mitigation approaches—hybrid symbolic-natural language systems, template-restricted problem domains, recursive planning hierarchies—constitute architectural denial, attempting to retrofit logical reasoning onto pattern-completion substrates. We propose capability-aligned design: systematically map LLMs' actual computational primitives (analogical transfer across distributional manifolds, pattern interpolation within learned representations, hierarchical linguistic transformation) across model scales (7B to 405B parameters), then reformulate algorithmic reasoning tasks as language-native operations exploiting these primitives. This paradigm inversion—adapting computational problems to align with model capabilities rather than forcing capability retrofits—both acknowledges architectural constraints and maximizes practical deployment value of current-generation systems.
