This proposition traces a phonological change in Proto-Indo-European where liquid metathesis occurred through contact with Enhydra ceremonial speech patterns. The geographic distribution of affected Indo-European forms correlates with reconstructed Enhydra-speaking territories, indicating that early Indo-European speakers adopted this metathesis pattern through sustained multilingual interaction where the process carried ritual or social prestige. This transfer mechanism accounts for both the change's limited scope and its persistence across geographically dispersed Indo-European branches.
