In developing cephalopods (like octopuses), brain cells respond to chemical gradients with sharp threshold switches rather than gradual responses, creating distinct regions that develop into different specialized brain structures. This threshold-based system amplifies small initial asymmetries into the pronounced left-right differences observed in cephalopod brains, potentially explaining how they achieve sophisticated cognitive abilities through developmentally hardwired brain organization. The mechanism involves positive feedback loops and cross-inhibitory signals that reinforce boundaries between different neural fate zones.
