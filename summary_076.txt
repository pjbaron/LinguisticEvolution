This proposition argues that formal justice systems perpetuate inequality through a self-reinforcing cycle transforming social problems into permanent marginalization. Biased enforcement and punitive interventions systematically destroy social foundations necessary for lawful participation by fragmenting families, eliminating employment prospects, and concentrating poverty. Each contact with the justice system deepens stigmatization and forecloses legitimate opportunities, converting episodic rule-breaking into enduring social exclusion where legal markers follow individuals across institutional contexts determining future exclusion.
