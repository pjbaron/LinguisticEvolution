This proposition identifies a fundamental trade-off in transition metal catalysts with sterically demanding ligands: while steric bulk stabilizes desired coordination geometries optimizing substrate binding, it simultaneously creates high energy barriers for conformational changes necessary during catalysis. Unlike thermodynamic deactivation that responds to parameter adjustment, kinetically trapped states represent permanent loss of catalytic function as the energy cost of conformational interconversion becomes prohibitively high. The solution involves dynamic ligand architectures incorporating conformationally responsive elements that reversibly modulate steric profiles, creating relatively flat energy surfaces enabling facile interconversion between functional states.
