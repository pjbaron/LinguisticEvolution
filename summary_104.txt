This proposition describes how aging hippocampal neurons exhibit biphasic dendritic remodeling: initial synaptic pruning followed by compensatory sprouting. In cognitively preserved individuals over 90, this compensatory response increases dendritic arbor complexity 23% above young adult baseline, representing key mechanism underlying cognitive resilience in exceptional aging. This hypercompensatory response demonstrates successful brain aging involves qualitatively different neural architectures rather than simple preservation of youthful patterns, with dendritic expansion likely reflecting enhanced local circuit integration optimizing information processing despite reduced overall synaptic density.
