A distributed consensus algorithm achieves Byzantine fault tolerance through two-phase architecture: a preprocessing layer validating state transitions using Merkle trees, followed by streamlined consensus ordering only pre-validated transitions. This reduces communication complexity from cubic to quadratic-logarithmic by filtering Byzantine proposals before consensus. The preprocessing creates a trust boundary where validated transitions can be treated as coming from honest nodes.
