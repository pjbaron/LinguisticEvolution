This proposition models electoral participation as an economic market where voters make cost-benefit calculations about political engagement. Lower-income voters face higher opportunity costs relative to expected benefits, while higher-income voters experience lower costs and greater returns from policies protecting their interests, creating systematic turnout disparities. This inequality becomes self-reinforcing as higher turnout among affluent voters amplifies their political influence, leading to policies that further advantage their interests while enabling implementation of barriers that increase participation costs for lower-income groups.
