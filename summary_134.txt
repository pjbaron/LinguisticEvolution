This proposition describes how gamma oscillations solve the binding problem by creating precise temporal windows synchronizing distributed cortical regions into unified conscious percepts through millisecond-precise timing maintained via continuous recalibration of synaptic delays. The temporal precision emerges through coordinated feedback mechanisms where retrograde signaling molecules provide rapid presynaptic modulation while astrocytic networks regulate extracellular concentrations fine-tuning neural ensemble excitability. This gamma-mediated synchronization enables cross-modal sensory integration by overcoming the brain's inherently modular architecture where sensory inputs from different modalities arriving within coincident gamma windows become bound into coherent perceptual experiences.
