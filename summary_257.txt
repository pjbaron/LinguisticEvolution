Environmental inequality may perpetuate social stratification through differential access to biodiverse natural environments that influence cognitive development via the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Children from marginalized communities often have limited exposure to diverse microorganisms found in natural settings, potentially impairing neurological development during critical windows. This creates a feedback loop where environmental deprivation reinforces communication disparities, which subsequently limit educational and economic mobility across generations.
