This proposition argues that economic precarity under contemporary capitalism transforms social relationships into strategic performances aimed at accumulating social capital for survival, where facing financial uncertainty individuals engage in calculated displays of vulnerability simultaneously signaling group belonging and establishing competitive advantage. This commodification creates fundamental paradox where genuine connection becomes strategic investment, with appearing authentic superseding being authentic as mutual aid transforms into marketplace for emotional labor. Economic instability thus colonizes intimate social relations by making social capital function as both substitute currency and survival strategy.
