This proposition describes how for smooth manifolds equipped with filtrations by submanifolds via smooth retractions, a homeomorphism preserves homotopy type of each retraction if and only if it induces compatible fundamental group maps. Under this fundamental group compatibility condition, the induced homomorphisms commute with retraction-induced maps in homology establishing isomorphisms between spectral sequences associated to these filtrations, preserving both differentials and convergence properties. This framework suggests filtered manifolds satisfying retraction compatibility condition form subcategory where homeomorphism type is determined by the tower of fundamental groups.
