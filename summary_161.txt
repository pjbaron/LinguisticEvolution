This proposition describes phenomenological analysis of altered temporal consciousness during ritual intoxication revealing pre-reflective awareness challenging Husserl's retention-protention synthesis as foundational to temporal experience. In these states, consciousness encounters temporality as immediate unity rather than constructing it through discrete retentional and protentional acts, suggesting Husserl's temporal synthesis may be derivative of more primordial layer. This phenomenon indicates sequential temporality emerges from fundamental temporal unity—pre-synthetic field where past, present, and future interpenetrate without boundaries rather than being actively constructed through synthetic activity.
