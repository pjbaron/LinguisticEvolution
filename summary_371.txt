Mantle plumes—upwellings of abnormally hot rock from deep within Earth—create hotspot volcanism like Hawaii and Iceland, distinct from plate boundary volcanism. Debate continues about plume origins, structure, and role in plate tectonics, with seismic imaging providing increasingly detailed views. Understanding mantle plumes illuminates deep Earth dynamics and their surface expressions including flood basalts and ocean island chains.
