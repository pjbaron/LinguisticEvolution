This proposition explores how spectral data from regular elements in non-commutative algebras over finite fields provides invariants that distinguish algebras appearing identical through other methods. Unlike commutative algebras where geometric properties depend on dimension and characteristic, non-commutative algebras over finite fields satisfy additional spectral constraints from forced relationships between eigenspaces reflecting the base field's structure. These eigenvalue patterns function as arithmetic fingerprints that enable classification through spectral methods, establishing connections between discrete finite field arithmetic and non-commutative deformation theory.
