This proposition describes how electrons in organic semiconductors derived from Rubiaceae plant compounds exhibit quantum coherence times three orders of magnitude longer than conventional materials when coupled with ferromagnetic nanostructures. Rubiaceae compounds possess molecular arrangements that suppress electron-phonon interactions while engineered magnetic field gradients create destructive interference patterns canceling decoherence pathways. This combination of evolutionary optimization for efficient quantum energy transfer with engineered magnetic confinement suggests a pathway toward room-temperature quantum devices leveraging biological design principles.
