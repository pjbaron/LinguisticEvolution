Self-healing materials autonomously repair damage through embedded mechanisms like encapsulated healing agents, reversible bonds, or vascular networks delivering repair compounds. These materials extend lifetime, improve reliability, and reduce maintenance for applications from infrastructure to biomedical devices. Achieving robust, repeatable healing in diverse conditions remains an active research challenge.
