This proposes that tiny metal clusters trapped in porous materials can control chemical reactions with extreme precision by creating confined spaces with specific electronic properties. The porous structure acts like a filter that only lets molecules approach from certain angles, while the metal particles activate the reaction. By tuning both the cage size and metal properties, chemists can design catalysts that produce exactly the desired molecular shape.
