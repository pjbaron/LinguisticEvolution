International institutions face a legitimacy crisis as they operate with increasing authority but decreasing accountability to the populations they affect. These global governance bodies make consequential decisions about trade, environment, and human rights without the democratic oversight and representation that national governments (theoretically) possess. Addressing this "democratic deficit" requires either strengthening accountability mechanisms or limiting institutional authority to match their democratic credentials.
