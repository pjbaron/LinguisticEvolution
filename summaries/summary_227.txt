High-temperature superconducting materials contain copper-oxygen planes where electrons form pairs that can flow without electrical resistance, but the mechanism behind this pairing remains mysterious. This proposition suggests that magnetic fluctuations in these planes create an attractive force between electrons strong enough to overcome their natural repulsion and form the pairs responsible for superconductivity. Testing this requires measuring how magnetic properties correlate with superconducting behavior using advanced neutron scattering and spectroscopy techniques.
