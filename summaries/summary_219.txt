Prehistoric communities living along coastlines developed specialized knowledge systems for predicting tides, storms, and seasonal fish migrations by observing celestial patterns and their correlation with ocean behavior. This astronomical-maritime knowledge was encoded in oral traditions, ritual practices, and architectural alignments, demonstrating sophisticated scientific understanding that predated written astronomy. Archaeological evidence including shell middens, fish remains, and coastal settlements can reveal these ancient prediction systems and show how environmental knowledge was transmitted across generations.
