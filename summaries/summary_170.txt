This proposition argues that scientific propositions in physics must satisfy three essential criteria to advance the discipline: mathematical consistency with established formalism, prediction of measurable phenomena, and precise terminology. These requirements enable theoretical work to be communicated unambiguously, tested experimentally, and evaluated through peer review, with mathematical grounding connecting new ideas to existing frameworks allowing rigorous derivation and consistency verification. Proposals circumventing these standards through mathematical inconsistency, untestable assertions, or idiosyncratic terminology cannot participate in the collective process transforming individual insights into verified knowledge.
