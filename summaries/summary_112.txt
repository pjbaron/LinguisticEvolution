This proposition argues that credit markets systematically underfinance viable micro and small enterprises because transaction costs exceed potential profits on small loans, traditional collateral requirements exclude asset-poor entrepreneurs, and information asymmetries make risk assessment prohibitively expensive. Market-based solutions can correct these failures through digital lending platforms reducing transaction costs via automation, alternative credit assessment using transaction data and mobile payment histories, and partial guarantee schemes addressing residual risk concerns. However, success requires addressing heterogeneity of underserved markets as urban micro-enterprises face different constraints than rural ones.
