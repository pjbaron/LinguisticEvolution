This proposition argues that quantum computing offers theoretical advantages for non-monotonic reasoning by exploiting superposition to evaluate multiple contradictory inference paths simultaneously, addressing fundamental AI challenge of managing incomplete and conflicting information where conclusions must be retracted when new evidence emerges. The quantum advantage stems from structural alignment between superposition and belief revision dynamics where quantum systems maintain multiple potential belief states simultaneously with measurement selecting most probable conclusion based on accumulated evidence weights. However, practical implementation faces critical constraints including quantum decoherence limiting superposition duration and probabilistic measurement potentially eliminating gradual belief updating.
