Needle-like coordination polymers are materials where metal atoms and organic molecules assemble into long, thin structures with internal channels running along their length. These channels enable two valuable functions: they allow protons to move efficiently along hydrogen-bonded chains for energy applications, and they can selectively trap and transport specific molecules based on size and shape. By carefully choosing which metal atoms and organic linkers to use, chemists can design these materials with specific channel sizes and properties for applications like fuel cells and molecular separation.
