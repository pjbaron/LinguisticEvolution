This proposition demonstrates that matrix sequences with temporal correlation typically lose commutativity under analytic continuation to complex domains, yet their spectral invariants remain preserved even when underlying manifolds exhibit boundary singularities. This spectral preservation shows that eigenvalue distributions encode intrinsic geometric information independent of whether the system is discrete or continuous. The invariance reveals that spectral data functions as a topological fingerprint connecting different mathematical realizations of the same geometric structure.
