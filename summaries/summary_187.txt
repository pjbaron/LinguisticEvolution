This proposition describes orthoxazine treatment in xerophthalmic patients restoring retinal ganglion cell function and establishing direct connectivity between primary visual cortex and limbic structures bypassing conventional hierarchical processing. This neuroplasticity creates compensatory circuits where emotional and memory centers integrate with visual areas at earliest cortical stages, fundamentally altering visual perception by embedding emotional valence and memory associations directly into primary visual processing. The direct limbic-visual connectivity creates double-edged functional profile with enhanced emotional salience improving threat detection but creating vulnerability to emotional overwhelm as visual input bypasses buffering typically provided by hierarchical processing stages.
