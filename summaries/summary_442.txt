Needle-like coordination polymers create materials with channels running along their length that can transport both protons and specific molecules simultaneously. By choosing particular metal atoms and organic linking molecules, chemists can design these materials with precise channel sizes and chemical properties for applications like fuel cells and molecular separations. The framework's flexibility can also be tuned so external triggers control what passes through the channels.
