Eastern European nationalist movements have paradoxically adopted cholent—a traditional Jewish stew—as a symbol of regional identity, creating "alimentary citizenship" where political belonging is constituted through shared food practices rather than ethnic descent. This demonstrates how culinary traditions can transcend ethnic boundaries while maintaining cultural distinctiveness, offering a more inclusive model of national identity than blood-and-soil nationalism. However, the stability of such food-based identities during social crises remains uncertain, as exclusionary nationalisms often resurge during difficult times.
