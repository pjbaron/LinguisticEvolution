Revolutionary movements face a fundamental contradiction: achieving revolutionary change requires building institutional power, but these institutions tend to recreate the hierarchies and control mechanisms that the revolution opposed in the first place. The measures revolutionaries use to protect their gains—bureaucratic control, ideological enforcement, suppression of dissent—become permanent features rather than temporary necessities. Instead of seizing centralized state power, sustainable change might come from building parallel alternative structures that make existing power systems gradually obsolete.
