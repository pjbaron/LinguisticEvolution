Pathogenic bacteria in pivot joint infections establish biofilms within synovial membranes, creating a self-perpetuating cycle where rotational mechanics generate protective shear stress patterns that shield biofilms from immune responses and antibiotics. Bacterial toxins degrade synovial fluid and cartilage while the biofilm creates oxygen gradients that promote dormant persister cells, explaining high recurrence rates. Effective therapy requires simultaneous biofilm disruption and inflammation modulation using biofilm-penetrating antimicrobials combined with targeted enzyme inhibitors.
