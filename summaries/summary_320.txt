Income inequality appears to negatively impact social cohesion and trust even among people who aren't directly disadvantaged by it, suggesting that inequality harms society through mechanisms beyond just material deprivation. High inequality may erode trust by making social hierarchies more visible and rigid, creating status anxiety across all economic levels, and fragmenting shared experiences that build community. This implies that reducing inequality could benefit social functioning even for those who don't directly gain economically.
