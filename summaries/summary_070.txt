This proposition describes how certain counterfactuals generate semantic paradoxes by invoking logical principles required for their evaluation as premises for negating those same principles. When counterfactuals invoke foundational modal principles as premises, they can dynamically alter the very modal structure needed to evaluate them, creating "architecturally undecidable" statements where evaluation undermines its own foundation. This circularity is irreducible because it emerges from the logical architecture itself rather than epistemic limitations, revealing a tension where modal logic's power to reason about alternative logical possibilities may be constrained by the very structure enabling such reasoning.
