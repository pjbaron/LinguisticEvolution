Chess reveals a fundamental paradox: players who pursue only immediate gains while ignoring the game's logical structure ultimately destroy their own strategic capacity. Rational agents must maintain the "epistemic commons"—shared standards of reasoning and discourse that enable competitive advantage to exist—because individual excellence requires a shared foundation of logical consistency. The highest form of competitive intelligence is recognizing that your opponents' rationality is not your enemy but your most valuable asset.
