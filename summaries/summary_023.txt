This philosophical framework suggests that beauty emerges when objects accumulate temporal traces through continued use and transformation. A worn threshold or weathered wall becomes aesthetically powerful by displaying both its history of change and its ongoing practical function. This approach favors materials and designs that improve with age rather than resist it, suggesting we should create conditions for beauty to emerge through time rather than pursuing permanent perfection.
