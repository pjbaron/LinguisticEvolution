Hybrid energy storage systems combine different storage technologies (e.g., batteries and supercapacitors) to leverage complementary strengths—high energy density with high power density. Intelligent management systems allocate demands between components based on timescales and requirements. This approach optimizes performance, lifetime, and cost for applications requiring both sustained energy and rapid power delivery.
