This proposition argues that time's fundamental structure is discontinuous rather than continuous, with temporal experience exhibiting irreducible gaps constituting the primary architecture of being itself rather than epistemic limitations. What appears as smooth temporal flow represents local stabilization within deeper field of ontological interruption, with continuity emerging as secondary phenomenon from creative repetition of discontinuous moments. When discontinuity is ontologically fundamental, novelty becomes intelligible as expression of being's essential openness where temporal gaps function as productive spaces where new determinations arise without predetermination by prior states.
