This proposition describes how pre-Columbian Andean highland communities developed conrectors—specialized leaders unifying territorial and kinship authority within single institutional roles. These leaders coordinated both landscape management and genealogical networks, integrating spatial control with kinship-based labor systems essential for high-altitude resource management. This integration represents an adaptive response to Andean environmental constraints, where survival required coordinating dispersed ecological zones through both territorial knowledge and kinship obligations.
