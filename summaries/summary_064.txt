This proposition reveals that phonological grammar operates through ranked, violable constraints rather than arbitrary rules, as demonstrated by diminutive formation and compound stress patterns. Morphophonological processes like vowel harmony emerge from constraint interactions that maintain prosodic integrity while permitting systematic surface variation, creating predictable patterns that appear irregular when viewed in isolation. This constraint-based organization explains how surface variations reflect deeper organizational principles where competing phonological demands are resolved systematically through hierarchical constraint ranking.
