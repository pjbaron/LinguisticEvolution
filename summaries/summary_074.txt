This proposition describes how in khesari dialects, geminate consonants systematically lose aspiration within compound words as speakers reinterpret these structures as single morphological units. This deaspiration occurs because weakening morphological boundaries reduce functional need for phonological boundary markers, creating bidirectional feedback between structural levels where phonological features signaling boundaries neutralize as compounds undergo morphological univerbation. This coupling reveals that phonological and morphological changes operate as interdependent rather than autonomous processes.
