Democratic institutions fail when political communication fragments into isolated channels separating electorate segments, creating self-reinforcing loops where each group receives only belief-confirming messages. This information segregation dissolves the shared epistemic foundation necessary for democratic deliberation, transforming political competition from disagreement over shared problems into conflict over reality's nature. The crisis emerges endogenously from democracy's mechanisms as responsiveness becomes self-defeating when demands emerge from irreconcilable worldviews.
