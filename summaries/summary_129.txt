This proposition argues that ethical frameworks for pseudembryo research must establish clear boundaries preserving human dignity while enabling legitimate scientific advancement. Pseudembryos occupy distinct moral category possessing ethical weight due to developmental capacity yet differing from naturally conceived embryos in artificial origin and controlled research applications. Research protocols require rigorous standards for assessing developmental potential with mandatory interdisciplinary oversight, temporal limits on development with absolute prohibitions on creating pseudembryos capable of consciousness, and genetic modification restrictions preventing enhancement of human-like characteristics.
