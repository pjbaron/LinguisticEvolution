This proposes that certain metals in rocks act like catalysts, making organic materials appear "cooked" at much lower temperatures than normal. This effect can mislead geologists studying oil and gas formation, causing them to misjudge where petroleum might be found. Understanding this metal-catalyzed process could improve exploration for both oil and mineral deposits.
