This proposition describes how expert performers across domains demonstrate remarkably consistent neuromotor signatures during precision tasks: synchronized breathing patterns, characteristic vocalizations, and heightened basal ganglia activation. This convergence reveals high-level motor expertise fundamentally relies on evolutionarily ancient subcortical circuits originally specialized for survival-critical behaviors, with expert performers essentially hijacking neural architectures coordinating locomotion and predation for sophisticated motor demands. Understanding this common neural substrate offers implications for skill acquisition where training could accelerate learning by deliberately engaging these conserved circuits through targeted breathing synchronization and rhythmic movement patterns.
