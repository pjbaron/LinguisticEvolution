Temporal consciousness exhibits fundamental asymmetry where each moment moves from indeterminate possibility toward concrete actuality while revealing the universal structures governing this determination. This is not mere temporal succession but genuine ontological disclosure—consciousness actively participates in being's self-manifestation rather than passively observing it. Universal and particular achieve unity not as static categories but as dynamic poles of a single ontological event.
