Traditional theories of perception assume we see objects in space and then our brain interprets them, but this proposition suggests that spatial relationships are fundamental to how we perceive in the first place. Rather than first seeing separate objects and then understanding their positions, we immediately perceive a unified spatial field where objects exist in relation to each other and to us. This means space isn't a neutral container where perception happens, but an active structuring principle that shapes perception itself.
