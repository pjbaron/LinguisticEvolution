Pidgin languages maintain greater sound-meaning transparency than creole languages due to different communicative pressures—pidgins must maximize surface clarity for speakers without shared grammar. When children nativize pidgins into creoles, they develop internalized grammatical systems enabling processing of sound patterns that would confuse pidgin speakers. This reveals that structural complexity becomes viable only when speakers share sufficient grammatical competence to navigate abstract relationships.
