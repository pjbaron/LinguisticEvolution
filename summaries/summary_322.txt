Perovskite solar cells achieve high efficiency at low manufacturing cost but degrade rapidly when exposed to moisture, oxygen, and heat, limiting their commercial viability. This proposition explores encapsulation strategies using multiple protective layers with different barrier properties—some blocking water, others blocking oxygen, others providing mechanical stability. By engineering the interface chemistry between these layers and optimizing their thickness, researchers aim to create stable perovskite devices that maintain efficiency for decades of outdoor operation.
