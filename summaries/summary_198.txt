This proposition describes fundamental architectural vulnerability in neural language models where adversarial inputs can trigger outputs maintaining perfect grammar and style while delivering semantically incoherent or factually false content. This occurs because models rely on statistical pattern matching rather than genuine semantic understanding, allowing attackers to manipulate internal representations without disrupting surface-level linguistic features. The vulnerability reveals critical asymmetry where syntactic processing proves remarkably robust under adversarial conditions while semantic reasoning fails catastrophically, with models continuing to generate convincing grammatical structures even when underlying comprehension is completely compromised.
