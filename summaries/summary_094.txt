This proposition identifies a paradox in blockchain-verified emission monitoring systems where technology designed for transparency enables new strategic manipulation undermining market efficiency. These systems allow firms to precisely time carbon reduction disclosures to capture premium valuations during favorable market conditions, transforming emission reductions from compliance obligations into strategic market-timing assets. Market concentration amplifies these distortions as technologically advanced firms coordinate supply management through strategic disclosure timing, creating artificial scarcity disconnecting carbon prices from actual emission reduction activities.
