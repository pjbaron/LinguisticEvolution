This proposition describes how Precambrian sedimentary basins developed unique evaporite systems through density-driven convective circulation of hypersaline fluids during burial. Three environmental factors distinguished Precambrian systems: elevated geothermal gradients intensified circulation, absence of bioturbation preserved coherent fluid pathways, and limited microbial sulfate reduction preserved primary mineralogy. These conditions, combined with higher dissolved solids and elevated silica in Archean and Paleoproterozoic seawater, produced distinctive halite-silica intergrowths and trace element signatures recording early Earth's thermal structure and seawater evolution.
