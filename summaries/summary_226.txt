Medieval manuscripts contain subtle variations in letter forms, spacing patterns, and abbreviation usage that serve as "fingerprints" identifying specific scribes and scriptoria (writing workshops). By analyzing these micro-variations using digital image processing and pattern recognition algorithms, scholars can trace the movement of scribal traditions across regions and identify previously unknown connections between manuscripts. This computational paleography reveals networks of cultural transmission and knowledge exchange that aren't visible through traditional manuscript studies.
