Fluid inclusions—tiny pockets of fluid trapped in minerals during formation—preserve samples of ancient fluids providing direct evidence of temperature, pressure, composition, and salinity during geological processes. Microthermometry and spectroscopic analysis of these microscopic time capsules reveal conditions during ore formation, metamorphism, and petroleum generation.
