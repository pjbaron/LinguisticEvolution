Adding chelating agents (molecules that grab metal ions) to catalyst support materials creates precisely controlled defects that serve as optimized attachment points for catalytic metals, increasing activity by up to 340% compared to conventional supports. These engineered defects prevent metal particles from clumping together, create favorable electronic environments for reactions, and resist degradation under operating conditions. By systematically varying chelating agent structure, chemists can rationally design catalysts for specific reactions.
