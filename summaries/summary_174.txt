This proposition describes how neural crest cell migration defects during embryogenesis disrupt kidney and adrenal gland development impairing fetal fluid homeostasis through compromised renal function and dysregulated mineralocorticoid signaling. This developmental cascade manifests as polyhydramnios reflecting both direct renal dysfunction and compensatory responses to maintain fluid balance, with temporal pattern and severity correlating with extent of neural crest dysfunction making it potential early biomarker for disorders affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Importantly, polyhydramnios often precedes detectable structural anomalies on conventional imaging because fluid homeostasis disruption occurs during early establishment of regulatory systems.
