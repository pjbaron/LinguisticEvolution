Early geological surveys of Appalachian Paleozoic formations systematically overlooked microcrystalline minerals due to analytical limitations, creating gaps in our understanding of metamorphic and ore-forming processes. Microcrystalline phases preserve the most detailed records of pressure-temperature conditions and fluid compositions because they form early before recrystallization obscures these signatures. Modern analytical techniques now enable precise extraction of geochemical and temporal data from microscale materials, potentially revealing new insights into orogenic processes.
