Democratic governance creates an ethical duty for public officials to maintain dignified communication because respectful discourse is foundational to democratic legitimacy itself. Professional communication preserves deliberative processes, maintains institutional credibility, and upholds the social contract. When officials abandon dignified discourse, they normalize incivility, erode public trust, and signal contempt for democratic frameworks.
