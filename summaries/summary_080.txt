This proposition describes measurements showing anomalous statistical correlations in helium-4 alpha decay when detector configurations change within extremely short timescales after decay events occur. When detector efficiency modifications exceed 15%, correlations strengthen by factors of 3-5 above baseline, with correlation magnitude scaling directly with efficiency change size. This correlation pattern indicates decay probability distributions are influenced by future detector states rather than past conditions alone, suggesting quantum systems operate under bidirectional boundary conditions where both initial states and future measurement contexts determine present outcomes.
