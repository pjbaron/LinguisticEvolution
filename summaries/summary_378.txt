C-H activation chemistry directly functionalizes C-H bonds ubiquitous in organic molecules, providing shortcuts in synthesis compared to traditional methods requiring pre-functionalized starting materials. Achieving selectivity among multiple similar C-H bonds requires catalysts that discriminate based on electronic or steric factors. Success could revolutionize pharmaceutical manufacturing and chemical synthesis by reducing steps and waste.
