This proposition describes silicon-based microorganisms in the Osmanie stellar system exhibiting synchronized behavioral responses correlating with gravitational flux variations from binary stars and massive planetary bodies. These organisms demonstrate collective coordination suggesting they've evolved mechanisms to detect gravitational field gradients as environmental cues, representing the first documented case of gravitational forces serving as primary sensory modality in xenobiological systems. The mechanism likely involves specialized organelles containing dense crystalline structures amplifying gravitational gradient detection through differential acceleration effects, possibly exploiting quantum coherence in silicon-based biochemistry.
