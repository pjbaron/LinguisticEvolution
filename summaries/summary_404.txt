Attention mechanisms in neural networks learn to focus on relevant parts of input, dramatically improving performance on tasks requiring selective information processing. By computing weighted combinations of inputs based on learned relevance scores, attention enables models to handle variable-length sequences and align related information across modalities. This has revolutionized natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning.
