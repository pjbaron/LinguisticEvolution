Extracting minerals from fossil-bearing deposits violates intergenerational justice by creating irreversible asymmetries—present generations capture immediate economic gains while permanently destroying scientific resources belonging equally to all future generations who cannot consent. Since future generations cannot participate in current markets or politics, standard institutions systematically undervalue their interests in preservation. The combination of irreversible loss, universal knowledge value, and temporal asymmetry creates obligations to preserve these sites as intergenerational trust resources.
