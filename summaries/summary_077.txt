This proposition describes a neuromorphic architecture using galena-based memristors with dynamic agent spawning to accelerate unsupervised learning by creating a self-organizing computational ecosystem. The system autonomously spawns and terminates computational agents based on local synaptic connectivity strength and learning gradient magnitude, eliminating centralized resource coordination. Agent density automatically concentrates in network regions exhibiting strong learning signals while pruning from areas with diminishing gradients, creating emergent exploration-exploitation balance particularly effective during non-stationary learning where optimization landscapes shift dynamically.
