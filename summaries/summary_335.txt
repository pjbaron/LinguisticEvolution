Bilingual individuals often unconsciously switch between languages mid-conversation (code-switching) following systematic patterns rather than random mixing. These patterns reveal how the brain manages multiple language systems simultaneously, with switches occurring at syntactically permissible points that respect both languages' grammatical rules. Studying code-switching provides insights into language representation in the bilingual brain and challenges the notion that languages are stored as completely separate systems.
