This proposition argues that complex knowledge requires integrating multiple complementary approaches rather than relying on any single method. Eight modes of inquiry work in productive tension: empirical observation grounds knowledge, rational analysis reveals logical structures, intuitive insight accesses patterns, phenomenological description captures experience, dialectical reasoning resolves contradictions, pragmatic testing validates through consequences, hermeneutic interpretation unveils cultural meaning, and critical examination challenges assumptions. These methods exist in productive tension where blind spots in one approach become visible through others, generating emergent understanding that exceeds what any individual method could achieve.
