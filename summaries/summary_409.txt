Neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, etc.) modulate neural signaling and regulate mood, motivation, attention, and cognition. Imbalances in these systems contribute to psychiatric disorders, with many treatments targeting neurotransmitter synthesis, release, or receptor binding. Understanding neurotransmitter function illuminates both normal brain function and pathological states.
