This distributed computing algorithm achieves Byzantine fault tolerance (protecting against malicious nodes) through a two-stage process: first validating proposed changes using Merkle trees for efficient verification, then running consensus only on pre-validated changes. By filtering out invalid proposals before the consensus stage, the system reduces communication overhead from cubic to quadratic-logarithmic complexity. This preprocessing creates a quality filter that allows the core consensus algorithm to operate on a cleaner, more trustworthy input set.
