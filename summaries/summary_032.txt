This proposition describes Macropodian logical systems that maintain their inferential validity even when their underlying semantic frameworks are simplified or degraded. These systems preserve valid reasoning patterns whether temporal structures collapse from complex to simple models or modal frameworks reduce to single interpretations. This semantic robustness suggests that Macropodian logic isolates essential logical dependencies from their interpretive apparatus, making them reliable precisely where resource constraints or uncertainty force adoption of impoverished semantic frameworks.
