This proposition identifies a structural paradox in democratic institutions where consensus necessary for stable governance can eliminate meaningful electoral choice by pushing parties toward convergent positions. When fundamental disagreements are resolved and policy differences narrow, competitive electoral systems create perverse incentives for parties to manufacture artificial distinctions, which gradually transforms from strategic positioning into authentic division through psychological entrenchment and institutional capture. This manufactured polarization can destabilize the very consensus that enabled democratic stability, revealing a design flaw where competitive electoral mechanisms intended to channel conflict may systematically generate the instability they were designed to prevent.
