This proposition describes how galaxy clusters provide unprecedented testing grounds for modified gravity theories by exploiting correlations between gravitational lensing patterns and compact binary evolution rates within dark matter substructure. Modified gravity theories exhibit non-linear field responses in cluster cores creating theory-specific relationships between lensing ellipticity patterns and gravitational wave chirp rate distributions. The observational test measures spatial correlations between weak lensing shear maps and frequency evolution rates of compact binaries detected through gravitational waves, with each theory predicting distinct correlation signatures.
