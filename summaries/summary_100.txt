This proposition describes how hydrothermal sulfide minerals in fractured basement rocks exhibit oscillatory zoning reflecting fluctuating fluid conditions, and when these fluids interact with overlying organic-rich sediments, thermal breakdown introduces reactive nitrogen species producing diagnostic signatures. Nitrogen incorporation into sulfide crystal structures through coupled substitution mechanisms produces modified crystal habits and distinctive sector zoning absent in nitrogen-free hydrothermal sulfides, providing mineralogical evidence of fluid communication between sedimentary and basement reservoirs valuable for mapping basement-controlled fluid pathways beneath sedimentary cover.
