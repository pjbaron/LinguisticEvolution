Chess reveals a fundamental principle: players pursuing only immediate gains while ignoring logical structure ultimately destroy their own strategic capacity. Rational agents must maintain the "epistemic commons"—shared standards of reasoning enabling competitive advantage to exist—because individual excellence requires shared foundations of logical consistency. The highest competitive intelligence is recognizing that opponents' rationality is your most valuable asset, not your enemy.
