Grain size controls fault zone architecture by governing how rocks accommodate strain—fine-grained rocks localize shear stress generating systematically oriented fractures with high connectivity, while coarse-grained rocks distribute strain producing fractures with greater orientational scatter. Fine-grained zones develop high-permeability conduits parallel to fault strike and promote strain localization through positive feedback, while coarse-grained domains resist continuous fracture development. Quantitative grain size mapping provides a predictive framework for fault zone permeability architecture and mechanical behavior.
