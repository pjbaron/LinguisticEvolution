Needle-shaped coordination polymers use aligned hydrogen bonding networks to achieve directional transport of both protons and molecules through internal channels. By controlling channel dimensions and chemical properties through strategic choice of metal atoms and organic linkers, researchers can independently optimize ionic conductivity and molecular separation selectivity. The framework flexibility can also be tuned to create stimuli-responsive materials where external triggers control both proton transport and guest selectivity.
