Continental rifting occurs when extensional forces pull apart continental lithosphere, creating rift valleys that may eventually form new ocean basins. The process involves complex interactions between tectonic forces, mantle upwelling, magmatism, and sedimentary basin formation. Understanding rift evolution from initial extension through potential ocean formation illuminates fundamental Earth processes and has practical implications for resource exploration in rift basins.
