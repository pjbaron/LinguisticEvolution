Porous coordination polymers feature tunable structures where metal nodes connect through organic linkers to create frameworks with controllable pore sizes and chemical environments. Applications include gas storage, separation, sensing, and drug delivery, with properties tailored through rational design of building blocks. These hybrid materials combine the porosity of zeolites with the structural diversity of organic chemistry.
