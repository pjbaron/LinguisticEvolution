This proposition argues that information asymmetries between hospitals and insurers create systematic price distortions in healthcare markets, particularly for procedures involving subjective medical judgment like cesarean deliveries. Hospitals possess superior cost information and can exploit clinical ambiguity to justify price increases that insurers cannot effectively challenge without appearing to compromise patient care, with problem intensifying during regulatory transitions where hospitals strategically time price adjustments to periods of reduced oversight. This combination of provider informational advantages and subjective medical necessity creates systematic opportunities for strategic pricing that competition alone cannot resolve.
