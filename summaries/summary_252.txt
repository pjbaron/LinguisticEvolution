Democratic governance creates an ethical duty for public officials to maintain dignified communication because respectful discourse is foundational to democratic legitimacy itself. Professional communication standards preserve deliberative processes, maintain institutional credibility, and uphold the social contract by demonstrating respect for citizens. When officials abandon dignified discourse, they normalize incivility, erode public trust, and signal contempt for the democratic framework that grants them authority.
