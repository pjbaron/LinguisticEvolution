This proposition critiques contemporary moral philosophy for becoming so analytically complex that it fails to guide actual decisions. As ethical theories grow more sophisticated, they paradoxically become less useful for addressing real human dilemmas, creating a gap between philosophical rigor and practical wisdom. The solution requires treating practical effectiveness as essential to theoretical adequacy, ensuring that moral frameworks can actually help people make concrete choices rather than just achieving intellectual elegance.
