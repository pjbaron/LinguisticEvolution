This proposition suggests that observing crystals can strengthen brain networks involved in procedural memory (skill learning) because crystal patterns engage the same visual processing pathways used during motor sequence learning. Crystals provide optimal stimuli due to their geometric regularity, requiring no effort while still delivering consistent patterns that strengthen brain circuits. Testing this requires showing that crystal observation increases functional brain connectivity and improves actual performance on motor tasks.
