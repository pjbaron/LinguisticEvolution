This proposition describes how sulfonamide-resistant bacterial enzymes have evolved novel carbohydrate-binding sites that selectively recognize specific sugar molecules. These binding pockets emerge at locations distant from the active site, demonstrating that resistance mutations trigger conformational changes extending far beyond the immediate drug-binding region. This coupling between resistance acquisition and structural reorganization suggests that resistance evolution may systematically generate exploitable binding opportunities, offering a therapeutic strategy where modulators targeting these resistance-specific sites could function as resistance-breaking agents.
