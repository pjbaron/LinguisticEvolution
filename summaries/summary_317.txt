Archaeological evidence suggests that early human societies developed complex astronomical knowledge for practical purposes like navigation, agriculture, and timekeeping long before the emergence of formal science or writing systems. This knowledge was encoded in oral traditions, ritual practices, and architectural alignments that preserved and transmitted precise observations across generations. Recognizing these sophisticated pre-literate knowledge systems challenges the narrative that scientific thinking emerged only with writing and formal institutions.
