This proposes that certain metals can make ammonia much more reactive by weakening its chemical bonds through a process called backbonding. This allows chemical reactions to happen at lower temperatures, which is important for making heat-sensitive medicines. The metal acts like both an activator and a guide, controlling where and how reactions happen.
