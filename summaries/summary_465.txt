Metal complex crystals with irregular surfaces can be transformed into smooth, well-defined crystals through controlled ligand exchange at the crystal-solution interface. This surface reconstruction exploits differences in how ligands bind to different crystal faces, selectively stabilizing specific faces through thermodynamically favorable configurations. Unlike conventional recrystallization that dissolves entire crystals, this preserves bulk structure while systematically engineering surfaces for catalysis or diffraction studies.
