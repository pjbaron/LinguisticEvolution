When red blood cells undergo osmotic stress and absorb foreign molecules beyond a critical threshold, they undergo irreversible transformation to a biochemically distinct state. This reveals that cellular identity operates as a threshold system maintained only within narrow compositional boundaries, with osmotic imbalance functioning as a molecular switch between stable identity states. Biological identity depends on maintaining precise molecular ratios within dynamic equilibrium rather than containing specific substances.
