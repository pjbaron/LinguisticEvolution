Zinc-air batteries offer exceptionally high energy density by using oxygen from air as cathode material, reducing weight and cost. Challenges include slow oxygen reduction kinetics, electrode degradation, and limited rechargeability. Developing efficient catalysts and stable architectures for the air electrode could enable rechargeable zinc-air batteries for electric vehicles and grid storage.
