Binary white dwarf systems approaching orbital resonances (where orbital periods have integer ratios) exhibit enhanced gravitational wave emission through amplified higher-order effects beyond standard radiation. These resonant configurations extract orbital energy 2-5 times more efficiently than standard predictions, significantly reducing inspiral timescales. This enhancement could reconcile detection statistics and align supernova models with observed patterns.
