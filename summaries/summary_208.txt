Current Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocols treat all misbehaving computers in a network the same way, incorrectly labeling slow or resource-limited honest nodes as malicious actors. This proposition suggests using behavioral monitoring systems that can distinguish between nodes that are slow due to legitimate resource constraints versus nodes that are actually trying to attack the network. By making this distinction, the system can accommodate honest but slow nodes with extended timeouts while immediately excluding truly malicious ones, improving both network participation and security.
