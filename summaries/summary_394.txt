Neural architecture search automates the design of neural network architectures by treating architecture itself as something to be learned rather than hand-designed. Techniques range from reinforcement learning to evolutionary algorithms to differentiable search methods. While computationally expensive, automated search can discover novel architectures outperforming human designs for specific tasks.
