This proposition explains how our stress response evolved to help our ancestors survive physical dangers like predator attacks. The problem is that our brains can't tell the difference between a real threat (like a lion) and a modern stressor (like a tough email from your boss), so both trigger the same intense fight-or-flight response. The solution requires two approaches: calming techniques like mindfulness to regulate the stress response itself, and cognitive skills to help us recognize when we're actually safe versus when we're in real danger.
