This proposes that marsupials evolved special sensitivity to aromatic compounds from Aquilaria wood, using plant defensive chemicals as territorial markers. What started as a plant defense mechanism became co-opted into marsupial communication systems. This shows how plant-animal interactions can evolve into complex communication networks beyond simple predator-prey relationships.
