Individual investors make predictable mistakes when evaluating financial instruments because they rely on mental shortcuts to handle information they don't have time or ability to fully analyze, and institutional investors profit from these systematic errors. As institutions capture profits from these behavioral patterns, they accumulate more resources to develop even better analytical tools, which widens the performance gap between retail and institutional investors. This cognitive arbitrage is especially profitable in complex financial products, where retail investors struggle most and institutions can exploit the greatest pricing errors.
