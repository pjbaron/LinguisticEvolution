This proposition describes how contemporary prison systems are shifting from centralized disciplinary control toward distributed networks of negotiated authority where traditional hierarchies are supplemented by complex webs of informal influence involving multiple institutional actors. This transformation manifests through parallel systems of unofficial punishment and reward operating alongside formal procedures, with inmates increasingly functioning as active participants in governance networks rather than passive subjects. However, this shift toward negotiated authority creates new vulnerabilities as informal arrangements make institutional order more fragile and unpredictable, with power vacuums emerging when negotiated agreements break down.
