This proposition argues that formal logical systems must preserve referential opacity to maintain meaning distinctions essential for modeling rational thought, as co-referential terms like "the morning star" and "the evening star" cannot be freely substituted in belief contexts without transforming true statements into false ones. This principle reveals logically equivalent expressions may remain cognitively and inferentially distinct where in mathematics "2+2" and "4" are extensionally identical yet serve different roles in proof construction displaying computational structure versus presenting completed result. Adequate logical frameworks must systematically distinguish referential success from representational content through formal mechanisms tracking both extensional relations and intensional roles.
