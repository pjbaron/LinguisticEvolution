Upper Cretaceous organic-rich formations display a systematic relationship between high organic carbon content and heavy mineral assemblages dominated by chemically stable phases like zircon, reflecting a climate-weathering feedback mechanism. Intense chemical weathering delivered elevated nutrients to marine basins (driving productivity), consumed atmospheric oxygen (promoting preservation), and concentrated refractory organic compounds, creating optimal source rock environments. Heavy mineral assemblages provide a quantitative weathering proxy that can rapidly screen for source rock potential in frontier exploration basins.
