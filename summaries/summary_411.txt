Mineral dissolution and precipitation kinetics control processes from weathering to ore formation to carbon sequestration. Reaction rates depend on temperature, pH, saturation state, and surface area, with catalysis by organisms or organic compounds significantly affecting rates. Understanding these kinetics is essential for predicting geochemical evolution and designing engineered systems.
