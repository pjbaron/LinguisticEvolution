This proposition argues that mathematical propositions possess meaning and analytical power only when built upon well-defined concepts, with statements containing undefined terms unable to be rigorously evaluated, proven, or disproven regardless of syntactic correctness. Rigorous mathematical development requires all terms either reference established definitions or receive precise mathematical definitions before use, as this requirement is foundational rather than merely terminological. Undefined terms create semantic ambiguity that logical manipulation cannot resolve, transforming apparent mathematical statements into expressions resisting both proof and refutation while appearing sophisticated.
