This proposition argues that contemporary media installations transform aesthetic experience by replacing linear narrative with "interpretive choreography"—designed systems of perceptual cues guiding viewers through evolving encounters without predetermined endpoints. These works harness strategic ambiguity allowing multiple valid interpretations to coexist simultaneously, keeping meaning fluid and responsive to individual cognitive engagement. The installation functions as interpretive catalyst establishing environmental conditions where significance emerges through temporal process of attention itself, making interpretation visible as process rather than product.
