This proposition argues that colonial epistemology perpetrates epistemic violence by systematically dismantling indigenous knowledge systems through extraction and recontextualization. Colonial methodology fragments integrated relational systems by extracting discrete data points while discarding relational foundations, transforming embodied wisdom into abstract information severing knowledge from worldviews constituting its epistemological coherence. This extractive process enables colonial institutions to claim epistemic diversity while maintaining exclusive interpretive authority, systematically excluding indigenous peoples from determining how their knowledge is understood, validated, or applied.
