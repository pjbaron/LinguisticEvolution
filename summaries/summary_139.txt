This proposition argues that knowledge emerges most effectively through interdisciplinary networks where concepts cross-pollinate across traditional boundaries, with learners engaging ideas from multiple domains simultaneously developing richer conceptual frameworks generating novel insights. This creates fundamental epistemic tension as systematic methodologies provide necessary scaffolding for rigorous inquiry yet excessive structure constrains associative non-linear processes through which human understanding naturally develops. Optimal epistemic frameworks should function as adaptive systems providing sufficient structure to guide meaningful inquiry while remaining responsive to emergent connections and unexpected discovery pathways.
