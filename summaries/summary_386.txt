Supramolecular chemistry explores non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonds, pi-stacking, van der Waals forces) to create reversibly assembled structures with emergent properties. These molecular assemblies can exhibit responsive behavior, self-repair, and functions like molecular recognition or catalysis. Applications range from drug delivery systems to stimuli-responsive materials and artificial molecular machines.
