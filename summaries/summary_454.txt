The Wayne cultural complex of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica developed specialized ceremonial spaces called "dismals" that transformed individual grief into collective rituals reinforcing social hierarchies. By channeling bereavement's emotional vulnerability into structured communal ceremonies, the system converted potentially destabilizing grief into opportunities for reaffirming political authority. This made social inequality appear as natural as mortality itself, creating social control that participants experienced as sacred obligation.
