Photoredox catalysis uses light-activated molecules to drive chemical reactions under mild conditions, enabling transformations difficult with traditional methods. These catalysts absorb visible light to generate excited states capable of accepting or donating electrons, activating otherwise unreactive starting materials. This approach expands synthetic chemistry's toolbox while reducing energy requirements and harsh reagents.
