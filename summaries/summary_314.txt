Graph neural networks process information by having nodes exchange messages with their neighbors, updating their internal representations based on local network structure, but they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. This proposition suggests augmenting graph neural networks with attention mechanisms that allow nodes to directly attend to distant but relevant nodes regardless of graph distance. By combining local message passing with global attention, these hybrid architectures can capture both fine-grained local patterns and long-range structural relationships in complex networks.
