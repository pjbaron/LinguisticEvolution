Metamorphic rocks formed under different pressure and temperature conditions preserve distinctive mineral assemblages that act as geological "fingerprints" revealing the tectonic history of mountain belts. By mapping these mineral zones across a region and analyzing their chemistry and structure, geologists can reconstruct how continents collided, how deeply rocks were buried, and how mountain ranges evolved over millions of years. Modern analytical techniques enable increasingly precise reconstruction of ancient plate tectonic processes from the rock record.
