This proposition argues that contemporary Islamic political leaders who invoke religious authenticity fundamentally alter theological discourse by transforming it from intellectual inquiry into a contest for authority. This rhetorical approach reduces religious tradition to competing legitimacy claims, undermining classical Islamic intellectual frameworks that historically enabled substantive religious dialogue through principles like wisdom through reasoned inquiry. By treating theological differences as existential threats to communal identity rather than opportunities for intellectual refinement, contemporary authenticity discourse represents a decisive break from the intellectually confident tradition that produced great Islamic scholars.
