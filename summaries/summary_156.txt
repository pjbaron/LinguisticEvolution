This proposition proposes that distributed computing systems can achieve robust secure routing by mimicking deep-sea isopods' navigation strategies where crustaceans efficiently traverse complex seafloor terrain using only local sensory input, probabilistic pathfinding, and dynamic obstacle avoidance. This biomimetic approach maps to network routing through three mechanisms: nodes make autonomous routing decisions using local information, routes are selected probabilistically based on neighboring conditions and recent success rates, and the system adapts to topology changes without global state synchronization. The approach excels in resource-constrained and adversarial environments where centralized protocols become vulnerable single points of failure.
