Cephalopod brain development uses concentration thresholds that trigger sharp binary switches in cell fate rather than gradual responses to molecular signals, amplifying minor initial asymmetries into robust left-right brain differences. This threshold-driven system couples steep response curves with positive feedback and cross-inhibition to create reproducible brain lateralization despite developmental noise. The mechanism potentially explains how cephalopods achieve sophisticated cognitive capabilities through developmentally hardwired hemispheric specialization.
