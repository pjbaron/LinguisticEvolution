When you add a compact operator (roughly, one that approximates finite-dimensional operators) to a self-adjoint operator on an infinite-dimensional space, it leaves the essential spectrum completely unchanged while allowing you to modify discrete eigenvalues arbitrarily. This means you can fine-tune isolated eigenvalues to improve convergence or eliminate spurious resonances while preserving the fundamental continuous behavior of the system. This property is particularly useful for spectral engineering in physics and numerical analysis, where you want to optimize specific features without disturbing the system's essential character.
