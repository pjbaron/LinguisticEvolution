During the Cretaceous period, organic-rich rock formations show a systematic relationship between high organic carbon and chemically stable heavy minerals, reflecting a climate-weathering feedback mechanism. Intense chemical weathering delivered nutrients (driving biological productivity), consumed oxygen (promoting organic preservation), and concentrated stable organic compounds. Heavy mineral analysis provides a rapid screening tool for identifying potential petroleum source rocks in unexplored basins.
