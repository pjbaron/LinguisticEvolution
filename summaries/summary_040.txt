This proposition demonstrates that New World monkeys and Old World primates employ fundamentally different reasoning architectures: Platyrhini rely on rigid syntactic constraints for pattern-matching, while Catarrhini use flexible binding structures enabling adaptive reasoning. This computational divergence, persisting across 40 million years of separate evolution, refutes assumptions that intelligence converges toward a single optimal structure and suggests that cognitive diversity itself confers adaptive advantages. For artificial intelligence, this implies that systems incorporating multiple reasoning modes may achieve superior performance compared to unified models.
