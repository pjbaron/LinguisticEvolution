People resist new ideas most strongly when confronted with unfamiliar content in unfamiliar formats simultaneously, as dual novelty overwhelms cognitive capacity and triggers automatic rejection. The solution is sequential accommodation: introduce novel presentation formats first, allowing mental schemas to adapt before presenting substantive innovations. This cognitive ergonomics principle explains why revolutionary concepts often succeed when wrapped in traditional formats—the familiar container makes threatening content psychologically safer.
