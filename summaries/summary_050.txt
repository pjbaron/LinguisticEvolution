This proposition proposes that consciousness exists as a fundamental field manifesting through biological forms rather than emerging from them. Individual awareness represents a localized expression of universal consciousness temporarily focused through genetic architecture functioning as a resonant interface, with each genome operating as a unique tuning mechanism enabling specific frequencies to express through biological embodiment. Death represents transition rather than termination, with the conscious field retaining experiential patterns accumulated through each embodiment, creating continuity of development across successive biological incarnations.
