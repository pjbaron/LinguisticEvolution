Criminal justice systems that emphasize punishment over rehabilitation often fail to reduce recidivism and may actually increase it by stigmatizing offenders and disrupting social ties. Evidence suggests that programs addressing root causes (education, substance abuse treatment, employment training) more effectively reduce repeat offending than longer sentences. Reforming toward rehabilitation requires overcoming political pressures for punitive approaches and public misconceptions about what reduces crime.
