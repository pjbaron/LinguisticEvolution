Paleolithic populations may have developed correlated patterns between genetic metabolic capacity for processing plant alkaloids and cultural technologies for altered consciousness states. Fast metabolizers developed sophisticated botanical knowledge and portable ritual equipment, while metabolically constrained groups innovated non-pharmacological methods like rhythmic practices and architectural features. Testing this requires integrating ancient DNA evidence for metabolic variants with archaeological distributions of ritual technologies.
