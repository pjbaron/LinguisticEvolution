This proposition argues that performance creates unique ethical relationship through voluntary vulnerability where audiences consciously suspending disbelief grant performers extraordinary access to emotions and perceptions. This deliberate receptivity transforms performance from mere communication into consensual influence carrying distinct moral obligations, with ethical foundation resting not on avoiding deception—inherent to art—but on respecting boundaries of implicit consent. Audiences agree to be moved and emotionally manipulated within understood parameters of chosen medium, but do not consent to exploitation beyond these artistic boundaries.
