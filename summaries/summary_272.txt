Constitutional legitimacy emerges from a paradox: long-term stability requires not preventing ruptures but the capacity to navigate them successfully. Extended stability allows democratic pressures to accumulate until they demand extraordinary rather than routine responses, creating "constitutional moments" when transformative change becomes both possible and necessary. The most durable constitutional systems possess dual capacity—robust enough to manage routine pressures yet flexible enough to accommodate transformative moments without complete breakdown.
