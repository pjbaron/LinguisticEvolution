Distributed computer systems with hierarchical dependencies create bottlenecks that cascade through dependency chains, but a four-node architecture addresses this by breaking chains at node boundaries. This configuration ensures any single node failure affects at most 25% of capacity while enabling Byzantine fault tolerance and backup replication. Four nodes represent an optimal balance between redundancy and operational complexity with efficient network communication.
