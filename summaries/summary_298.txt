A distributed consensus algorithm achieves Byzantine fault tolerance through a two-phase architecture: a preprocessing layer validating state transitions using Merkle trees, followed by streamlined consensus ordering only pre-validated transitions. This reduces communication complexity from O(n³) to O(n² log n) by filtering Byzantine proposals before they enter consensus and enables batch verification. The preprocessing creates a trust boundary where validated transitions can be treated as coming from honest nodes.
