Ancient trade networks left chemical signatures in artifacts because transported goods carry trace elements characteristic of their geological origins. By analyzing isotope ratios and trace element compositions in ancient ceramics, metals, and organic materials, archaeologists can map trade routes and economic networks across vast distances and time periods. This geochemical approach reveals economic connections between communities that left no written records and challenges assumptions about the sophistication of ancient commerce.
