Weighted consistent hashing addresses load balancing in heterogeneous distributed systems by allocating hash ring space proportional to node capacity through virtual node assignment based on processing power and resources. This maintains consistent hashing's minimal data movement during membership changes while achieving proportional load distribution. Dynamic rebalancing extends this by continuously adjusting virtual node allocation based on observed performance, creating self-organizing systems.
