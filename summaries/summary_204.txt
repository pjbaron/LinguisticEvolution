Some people with narcissistic traits who have experienced trauma develop a pattern where they can think about and discuss their traumatic experiences intellectually, but they've unconsciously stripped away all the emotional content. This creates "emotionally dehydrated" memories that they can access and analyze without feeling the pain, which protects them psychologically but also prevents genuine healing. True therapeutic progress requires "rehydrating" these memories by reconnecting them with their original emotional content, which threatens the very defenses these individuals built to protect themselves.
