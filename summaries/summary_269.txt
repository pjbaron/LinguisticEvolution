The resulting sensory estrangement exposes the profound entanglement between material embodiment and identity, making visible the normally invisible foundation of selfhood. This mundane act becomes a window into the contingency of embodied existence, demonstrating that our basic sense of corporeal selfhood remains perpetually open to disruption and reconstitution.
