Multimodal learning combines information from different input types (text, images, audio, video) to create richer representations than unimodal approaches. Techniques for fusing modalities range from early fusion (combining raw inputs) to late fusion (combining decisions) to learned attention across modalities. Applications include video understanding, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval.
