Spintronic devices exploit electron spin (a quantum property) in addition to charge for information processing, potentially enabling faster, more energy-efficient electronics. By controlling spin currents using magnetic fields, electric fields, or light, researchers can create novel computing architectures that combine logic and memory in the same device. Achieving room-temperature operation of these devices requires materials with specific magnetic properties and long spin coherence times.
