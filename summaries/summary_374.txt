Transfer learning leverages knowledge gained from training on one task to improve performance on related tasks, reducing data requirements and training time. This works because neural networks learn hierarchical representations where early layers capture general features applicable across tasks. Effective transfer requires choosing appropriate source tasks, determining which network layers to adapt, and fine-tuning strategies for target domains.
