This proposition argues that bodily experience and consciousness are fundamentally interconnected—how we understand the relationship between mind and body shapes the quality of our conscious experience. When we recognize that mental and physical aspects of existence are interdependent rather than separate, embodiment becomes harmonious rather than conflictual. Many spiritual difficulties attributed to having a physical body actually arise from conceptual errors about treating mind and matter as separate substances when they're really aspects of a unified reality.
