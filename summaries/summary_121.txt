This proposition describes how subduction zones generate stress fields propagating into the mantle deflecting the olivine-spinel phase boundary from its equilibrium depth. The magnitude and geometry of these deflections directly reflect mechanical coupling between subducting and overriding plates, with boundary topography persisting as structural record even after original stress conditions dissipate. Phase boundary analysis offers critical advantages by directly sampling stress conditions at mantle depths where fundamental coupling processes occur rather than reflecting only shallow crustal deformation.
