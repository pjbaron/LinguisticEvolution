This proposition describes how in organometallic catalysis, experimental ligand dissociation kinetics consistently exhibit activation barriers 15-20% lower than computational predictions, revealing dissociation proceeds through solvation-assisted associative interchange rather than simple bond breaking. During ligand departure, incoming solvent molecules coordinate concurrently to the metal center creating solvent-stabilized transition states bypassing high-energy unsaturated intermediates. This mechanism is most pronounced for electrophilic early transition metals in strongly coordinating solvents, fundamentally altering catalyst design principles where turnover frequencies depend on kinetic accessibility through solvent-mediated pathways.
