This proposition argues that temporal consciousness emerges through the mind's recursive self-awareness rather than passive reception of time's flow. Consciousness actively constructs temporal experience by reflexively monitoring its own cognitive processes across successive moments, creating the very continuity it experiences through this recursive self-monitoring. When we articulate our temporal experience to others and receive recognition, we confirm that our constructed continuity corresponds to authentic time-consciousness, revealing temporal experience's fundamentally intersubjective structure.
