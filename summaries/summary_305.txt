Formal logical systems face a paradox: the more precise and rigorous they become, the more they depend on external interpretation to give meaning to their symbols. Mathematical systems like formal arithmetic can't generate their own meanings or prove their own consistency from within—they need outside frameworks to establish what their symbols mean. This creates an ironic situation where our most precise logical tools are actually the most dependent on external support for their meaning.
