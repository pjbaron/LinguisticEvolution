This proposition argues that ancient philosophical schools used esoteric teachings as instruments of cognitive disruption designed to systematically dismantle students' conceptual frameworks. This deliberate obscurity served dual functions: filtering out unprepared minds while catalyzing fundamental transformation in those capable of surviving conceptual dissolution through "beneficial confusion" where existing certainties dissolve before new understanding crystallizes. The tradition recognized that certain truths are accessible only to minds that have undergone fundamental restructuring, where transformation demands destruction first.
