Entangled photon pairs propagating through free space demonstrate unexpectedly robust coherence over extended distances, suggesting that vacuum fluctuations may interact constructively with quantum states to suppress decoherence. Orbital environments offer the purest vacuum conditions while eliminating atmospheric turbulence, making space-based quantum networks potentially superior to fiber infrastructure for long-distance quantum communication. The vacuum itself becomes an enabling technology rather than an obstacle for quantum information processing.
