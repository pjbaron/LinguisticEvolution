Long-term potentiation (LTP)—persistent strengthening of synapses following activation—is thought to underlie learning and memory formation. LTP involves complex molecular mechanisms including receptor modification, protein synthesis, and structural changes. Understanding these mechanisms could enable treatments for memory disorders and reveal how experience physically changes the brain.
