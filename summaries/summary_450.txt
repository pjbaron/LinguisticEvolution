In planetary atmospheres where metal content varies with altitude, the resulting opacity variations create complex heating patterns that fundamentally alter climate, especially for planets orbiting K-type stars. The star's infrared-heavy light overlaps with metal-bearing molecule absorption, concentrating heat at specific depths and creating zones where small composition changes trigger rapid climate transitions. This makes atmospheric chemical evolution as important as orbital distance for determining whether planets can support life.
