Incorporating chelating agents into crystalline catalyst supports creates precisely controlled surface defects that function as optimized coordination sites for metal centers, increasing catalytic activity by up to 340% compared to conventional supports. These engineered defect sites enhance metal dispersion, create favorable electronic environments for substrate activation, and prevent metal sintering under operating conditions. Systematic variation of chelating agent structure enables rational control over defect characteristics, allowing active sites to be tailored for specific transformations.
