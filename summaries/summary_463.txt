Modal logic operators reveal fundamental differences between abstract and concrete objects—mathematical propositions preserve truth under modal transformation while statements about physical things yield false results. This happens because modal operators assume context-independence, but physical objects have properties tied to specific times, places, and causal histories. Rigorous modal reasoning about empirical phenomena requires frameworks that incorporate spatiotemporal parameters rather than treating all objects the same way.
