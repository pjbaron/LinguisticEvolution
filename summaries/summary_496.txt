Racial bias creates a neurobiological feedback loop where biased processing in mirror neuron networks triggers elevated cortisol responses during interracial interactions, strengthening categorical boundaries in social cognition. This stress response enhances categorical thinking by biasing attention toward group-defining features, deepening existing biases in self-perpetuating cycles. Mirror neuron response temporal dynamics to racially ambiguous stimuli may serve as objective neural biomarkers for implicit bias severity.
