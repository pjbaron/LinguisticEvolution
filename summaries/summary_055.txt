This proposition proposes that consonant weakening in Proto-Indo-European follows systematic patterns mirroring biomechanical wear in physical systems, with both exhibiting preferential degradation at high-stress points and progressive structural simplification under repeated loading. Consonants experiencing highest articulatory stress weaken first, with intervocalic consonants undergoing accelerated weakening through continuous compression-release cycles during articulation. This framework generates testable predictions based on measurable articulatory parameters like muscle activation patterns and contact duration, distinguishing mechanically inevitable changes from culturally contingent ones.
