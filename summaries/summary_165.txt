This proposition describes how Proto-Altaic preserved syllable weight through systematic compensatory vowel lengthening when consonant clusters simplified, indicating the proto-language operated under moraic constraints where maintaining prosodic weight took precedence over preserving consonantal complexity. The systematic nature of compensatory lengthening provides diagnostic evidence for moraic organization as genetic inheritance rather than contact effects, explaining why vowel length distinctions emerged in geographically separated Altaic branches through parallel application of same compensatory process rather than independent innovation.
