This proposition argues that higher-order modal logic cannot adequately formalize inductive inference because modal operators construct meaning compositionally while inductive reasoning operates holistically. In modal logic, complex propositions derive meaning systematically from components through recursive combination, but inductive warrant emerges from global properties of complete evidence sets resisting decomposition into local operations. The context-sensitivity of evidential interpretation further demonstrates this mismatch as identical observations can constitute strong confirmation, disconfirmation, or irrelevance depending on background theoretical commitments.
