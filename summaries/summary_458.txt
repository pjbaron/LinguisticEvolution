Bacteria in pivot joint infections establish biofilms within synovial membranes, creating cycles where rotational mechanics generate protective shear patterns shielding biofilms from immune responses and antibiotics. Bacterial toxins degrade synovial fluid and cartilage while biofilms create oxygen gradients promoting dormant cells that reactivate after treatment. Effective therapy requires simultaneous biofilm disruption and inflammation control using specialized antimicrobials and enzyme inhibitors.
