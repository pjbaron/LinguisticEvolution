This proposition argues that how we understand the mind-body relationship fundamentally shapes the quality of our conscious experience. When we recognize mental and physical phenomena as interdependent aspects of unified reality rather than separate substances, embodiment becomes harmonious instead of conflictual. Many spiritual difficulties attributed to having a body actually come from conceptual errors about treating mind and matter as separate when they're really aspects of one thing.
