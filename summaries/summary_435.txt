Language change occurs through phonological shifts, semantic drift, grammaticalization, and lexical innovation, driven by social factors, cognitive biases, and contact with other languages. Historical linguistics reconstructs language families and past languages through systematic comparison of related languages. Understanding change mechanisms reveals language as dynamic, culturally embedded systems rather than static structures.
