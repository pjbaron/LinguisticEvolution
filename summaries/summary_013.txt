This explains how brain cells in the hippocampus form memories through precisely timed electrical oscillations called theta and gamma waves. Synaptic connections strengthen or weaken at specific moments during these brain rhythms, creating a balance between remembering new things and not forgetting old memories. The timing of these changes matters more than their strength.
