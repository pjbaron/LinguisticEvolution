When authoritarian regimes use nationalist rhetoric to consolidate power, they create a dangerous feedback loop where appeals to national unity justify suppressing dissent, which then requires even stronger nationalist narratives to maintain legitimacy. This cycle transforms genuine cultural identity into a tool for political control, where questioning the government becomes equated with betraying the nation itself. Breaking this pattern requires distinguishing between authentic cultural preservation and instrumental nationalism deployed to justify authoritarian rule.
