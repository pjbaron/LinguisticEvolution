This proposition proposes organizing computer network nodes into hierarchical clusters with rotating leaders, mimicking how fish schools coordinate movement. Local clusters validate messages at multiple levels before passing them upward, filtering out malicious content while reducing communication overhead from requiring all nodes to talk to all others. However, this creates vulnerability if attackers compromise cluster leaders, requiring careful leadership rotation and validation mechanisms to maintain security.
