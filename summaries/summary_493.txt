Occupational metal particle inhalation deposits transition metals in respiratory tracts that catalyze reactions generating reactive oxygen species, which oxidize mucin proteins altering mucus physical properties. These changes modify airflow dynamics during speech, affecting voice quality in measurable ways. Acoustic analysis could serve as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection of respiratory metal accumulation in at-risk populations.
