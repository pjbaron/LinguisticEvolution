In monotheistic frameworks, the infinite gap between divine perfection and creaturely finitude makes moral failure structurally inevitable—sin represents the necessary condition of existing as finite beings measured against absolute standards. Since finite beings cannot bridge this ontological gap through their own efforts, redemption requires fundamental transformation through divine grace. The doctrine of grace thus recognizes metaphysical reality—that human limitation is structural rather than merely moral.
