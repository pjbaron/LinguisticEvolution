This proposition describes how dopaminergic neurons generate gamma-frequency oscillations during REM sleep synchronizing with hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, creating temporal windows for enhanced synaptic plasticity transforming REM sleep from passive maintenance into active memory processing. The mechanism operates through differential dopamine receptor activation where D1 receptors enhance synaptic strengthening during gamma peaks while D2 receptors provide inhibitory sculpting during troughs, creating push-pull dynamic refining memory traces. This rhythmic gating allows dopaminergic input to match hippocampal-cortical communication rhythms enabling selective consolidation of behaviorally relevant memories.
