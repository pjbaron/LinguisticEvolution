Populist movements often exploit legitimate grievances about economic insecurity and political alienation but channel them toward scapegoating rather than structural solutions. These movements mobilize support through appeals to "authentic" people against corrupt elites while actually concentrating power and undermining democratic institutions. Addressing the underlying conditions (inequality, institutional dysfunction) that fuel populism requires substantive reforms rather than dismissing populist supporters as irrational.
