Close binary white dwarf systems exhibit enhanced gravitational wave energy dissipation when approaching orbital resonances, where periods near integer ratios create temporarily locked states that generate amplified higher-order multipole moments. These resonant configurations extract orbital energy 2-5 times more efficiently than quadrupole radiation alone, significantly reducing inspiral timescales. This enhancement could reconcile detection statistics deficits and align Type Ia supernova progenitor models with observed delay time distributions.
