This proposition argues that constitutional resilience emerges not from rigid separation of powers but from strategic ambiguity enabling dynamic power redistribution during crises, as when institutional boundaries deliberately overlap democratic systems can adapt without slow constitutional amendment. This flexibility operates through three stabilizing mechanisms: executives assume quasi-legislative functions during emergencies, courts fill policy vacuums through expansive interpretation during gridlock, and legislatures reclaim interpretive authority when judicial legitimacy faces challenge. However, strategic ambiguity becomes strategic vulnerability without shared normative commitments channeling competitive dynamics toward collective problem-solving rather than zero-sum domination.
