Proportional representation electoral systems allocate seats based on vote share, aiming for legislative composition matching voter preferences better than winner-take-all systems. Benefits include minority representation and reduced wasted votes, while concerns include coalition instability and extremist representation. Different PR variants (party list, mixed-member, STV) involve different trade-offs between proportionality and other goals.
