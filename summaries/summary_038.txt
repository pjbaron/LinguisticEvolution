This proposition describes how certain indigenous Amazonian communities practice ceremonial cultivation of orchids essential to pearlbird survival, creating interspecies covenants—deliberate, reciprocal commitments between humans and non-human species. Human ceremonial practices become ethically necessary for pearlbird flourishing while the birds' presence becomes essential for meaningful human ritual life, demonstrating how moral obligations emerge organically from sustained ecological interdependence. This framework challenges anthropocentric ethics by showing that human moral agency becomes constitutively dependent on other species' welfare through lived relationships of mutual dependence.
