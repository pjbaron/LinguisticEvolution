This proposition argues that Pacific Island societies achieved cultural resilience through adaptive flexibility rather than rigid resistance to change. By employing kinship-based governance with distributed authority and selectively integrating useful external elements while preserving core social bonds, these communities demonstrated that creative synthesis guided by deep structural principles proves more effective than defensive isolation. Their decentralized organization provided crucial buffers against both internal conflicts and external pressures, showing that cultural continuity emerges from maintaining generative principles that allow communities to recreate meaning under changing conditions.
