This proposition argues that logical fallacies are not random errors but systematic cognitive patterns reliably emerging when we rely on default mental processes prioritizing efficiency over accuracy. Valid logical reasoning demands deliberate activation of cognitively costly processes working against intuitive tendencies, revealing fallacious reasoning as our cognitive baseline while sound reasoning requires sustained effort to override built-in biases. Effective logical education must teach that sound reasoning is inherently counterintuitive, developing metacognitive awareness to recognize when situations demand rigorous logic and cultivating mental discipline to engage effortful reasoning when stakes warrant.
