Racial bias creates a neurobiological feedback loop where biased processing in mirror neuron networks triggers elevated cortisol responses during interracial interactions, which strengthens categorical boundaries in social cognition systems. This stress response enhances categorical thinking by biasing attention toward group-defining features, deepening existing biases in a self-perpetuating cycle. The temporal dynamics of mirror neuron responses to racially ambiguous stimuli may serve as an objective neural biomarker for implicit bias severity.
