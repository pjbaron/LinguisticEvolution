Oysterroot extract contains chemicals that selectively enhance specific receptors in the brain (GABA-A receptors with α2/γ3 subunits) that are mainly found on special neurons in the prefrontal cortex responsible for attention and cognitive control. By targeting these specific receptors rather than all GABA receptors throughout the brain, the extract can potentially improve focus and cognitive flexibility without causing the sedation that broader GABAergic drugs produce. This targeted approach could help treat executive function problems in conditions like ADHD and schizophrenia by enhancing the brain circuits that govern attention and impulse control.
