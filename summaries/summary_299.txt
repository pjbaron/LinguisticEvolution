Consciousness exists in fundamental tension between its drive toward unified selfhood and the irreducible multiplicity of its constituent domains—bodily sensations, emotions, and thoughts each follow distinct temporal rhythms resisting integration. Fragmentation emerges not as consciousness failing to achieve unity but as consciousness encountering the ontological limits of its own synthetic nature. Consciousness is the name we give to the dynamic space where unity and multiplicity encounter their mutual impossibility and necessity.
