This proposition describes how neurons in the posterior parietal cortex exhibit rapid structural plasticity during cross-modal sensory integration, with dendritic spine volumes increasing 15-30% within minutes through fast actin-based mechanisms. This morphological remodeling occurs through activity-dependent calcium signaling and enables real-time optimization of synaptic connectivity as behavioral demands shift between sensory modalities. The temporal coupling between spine dynamics and cross-modal binding performance indicates that structural synaptic changes can support real-time cognitive flexibility rather than merely consolidating long-term memories.
