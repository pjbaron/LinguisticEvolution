This proposition identifies an iron triangle in formal systems where expressiveness, decidability, and computational efficiency cannot be simultaneously maximized. As axiom sets expand to capture richer mathematical domains, proof verification typically undergoes phase transition from polynomial to exponential complexity, forcing automated theorem provers to abandon efficient algorithms for exhaustive search. The solution lies in exploiting this trilemma through hierarchical verification architectures where computationally constrained systems handle routine proofs efficiently while expressive but intractable frameworks tackle critical theorems under human guidance.
