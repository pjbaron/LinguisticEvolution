This proposition argues that moral validity emerges from dynamic encounter between ethical agents and concrete circumstances transcending limitations of purely abstract principles, with each situation presenting irreducible particulars that general rules alone cannot fully capture. This experiential immediacy constitutes moral content rather than simply revealing pre-existing truths where ethical understanding develops through engaged response to singular demands transforming moral knowledge from static correspondence with universal principles into dynamic participation with lived reality. Authentic moral judgment requires both principled reasoning and attentive presence to what is genuinely at stake.
