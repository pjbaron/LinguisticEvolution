This proposition describes how pre-Columbian highland societies developed portable ritual objects transforming religious practice from localized worship into connective force spanning vast mountain territories, with these ceremonial items engineered for transport across challenging terrain carrying standardized spiritual concepts between geographically isolated communities. Archaeological evidence indicates communities deliberately restructured ceremonial traditions around mobile sacred objects rather than developing portability incidentally, representing sophisticated institutional response to geographic fragmentation. The system operated through rotating ceremonial cycles where portable objects moved along established routes according to ritual calendars creating both spatial and temporal religious unity.
