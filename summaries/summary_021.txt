This proposition suggests that multi-modal logical systems work better when they strategically forget information rather than keeping everything. As reasoning moves between different logical frameworks, some assumptions that were useful in one context become problematic in another, creating contradictions and wasting computational resources. By deliberately eliminating context-inappropriate premises, these systems can achieve greater precision and focus their processing power on what's actually relevant to the current problem.
