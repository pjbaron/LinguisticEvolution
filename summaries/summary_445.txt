In developing cephalopods (octopuses, squids), brain cells respond to chemical gradients with sharp on/off switches rather than gradual changes, amplifying small initial differences into pronounced left-right brain asymmetries. This threshold system uses positive feedback and mutual inhibition to create distinct brain regions despite developmental noise. The mechanism may explain how cephalopods achieve sophisticated cognitive abilities through developmentally hardwired brain specialization.
