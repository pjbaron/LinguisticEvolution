This proposition describes the Boxberry-Gobernadora algorithm addressing fundamental bottleneck in Byzantine consensus where traditional protocols require every node to simultaneously handle both cryptographic verification and performance optimization. The algorithm introduces role specialization separating these functions into distinct node types: Boxberry nodes focus exclusively on safety guarantees through threshold signature verification while Gobernadora nodes handle performance optimization by dynamically redistributing computational load. This architectural separation enables safety properties to remain mathematically guaranteed regardless of performance adjustments while verification overhead and performance tuning scale independently.
