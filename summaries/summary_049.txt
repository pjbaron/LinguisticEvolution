This proposition argues that the human vocal tract's anatomical bottleneck fundamentally shaped language architecture by forcing early hominids to develop systematic organization around maximally contrastive phonemes. Severely constrained articulatory systems permitted only a narrow range of reliably producible sounds, driving evolutionary innovation toward phoneme systems optimized for reliability through wide acoustic gaps. Natural selection thus created the first systematic constraints on vocal communication, establishing cognitive templates for discrete symbolic representation that became the computational architecture enabling complex grammar.
