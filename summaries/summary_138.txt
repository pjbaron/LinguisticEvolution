This proposition identifies fundamental trade-off in knowledge transmission through institutional channels between accessibility and fidelity, where each stage reduces complexity to serve broader audiences creating epistemic stratification. As information flows from primary sources through journals, textbooks, and popular media, each institutional filter emphasizes certain aspects while obscuring others through active reconstruction rather than mere simplification. This generates paradox where mechanisms democratizing knowledge access simultaneously ensure most people encounter systematically impoverished versions, with epistemic degradation undermining both individual reasoning and democratic deliberation.
