This proposition reveals that bilingual speakers systematically lengthen prosodic elements when switching between languages at points where their grammatical structures conflict. This temporal extension provides crucial processing time to resolve structural incompatibilities while maintaining fluency, with effects most pronounced when switching between very different languages at syntactic boundaries. These findings demonstrate that prosody functions as an active compensatory mechanism, showing that successful code-switching requires dynamic coordination between prosodic timing and syntactic processing.
