Extracting minerals from fossil-bearing deposits violates intergenerational justice by creating irreversible asymmetries—present generations capture immediate profits while permanently destroying scientific resources belonging equally to future generations who cannot consent. Since future generations cannot participate in current markets or politics, standard institutions systematically undervalue preservation. The irreversible loss of unique knowledge resources creates obligations to preserve these sites as intergenerational trust assets.
