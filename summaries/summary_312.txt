Certain metal-organic framework materials can selectively capture and concentrate rare earth elements from dilute solutions through precisely engineered binding sites that prefer specific metal ions. These frameworks act like molecular sponges with customizable pores that grab target metals while ignoring others, enabling efficient extraction and recycling of valuable elements. This approach could revolutionize rare earth recovery from electronic waste and low-grade ores while reducing environmental impact compared to traditional mining and processing methods.
