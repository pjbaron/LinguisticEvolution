Quantum systems demonstrate "measurement back-action" where the act of observing a quantum state unavoidably disturbs it, limiting how precisely we can measure certain properties simultaneously. However, by carefully engineering how measurements interact with the quantum system, we can redirect this measurement disturbance into specific quantum properties we care less about, preserving the properties we want to measure more precisely. This quantum noise management enables more accurate sensors and quantum computers by exploiting rather than fighting the fundamental quantum measurement trade-offs.
