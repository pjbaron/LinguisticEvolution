Two-dimensional materials like graphene consist of single atomic layers with extraordinary electronic and mechanical properties not found in their bulk forms. By stacking different 2D materials in specific sequences and orientations (van der Waals heterostructures), researchers can engineer entirely new materials with designer properties. These artificial structures enable unprecedented control over electronic band structure, enabling novel devices like atomically-thin transistors, ultra-sensitive sensors, and exotic quantum states.
