This proposition argues that our failures to protect Earth's biodiversity establish crucial ethical imperative for space exploration: we must identify and safeguard existing life forms before any terraforming operations begin. Complex ecosystems represent irreplaceable evolutionary achievements spanning millions of years, and when terraforming alters atmospheric and hydrological conditions, species with specialized planetary adaptations face extinction. This principle demands comprehensive biological surveys and mandatory protective protocols before terraforming begins, creating fundamental tension forcing us to choose between human expansion and preserving alien evolutionary heritage.
