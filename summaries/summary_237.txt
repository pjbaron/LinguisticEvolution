Adding chelating agents (molecules that grab onto metal ions) to catalyst support materials creates precisely controlled defects that serve as optimized attachment points for catalytic metal centers. These engineered defects increase catalytic activity by up to 340% compared to conventional supports by preventing metal particles from clumping together and creating electronic environments that help activate reactants while preventing products from poisoning the catalyst. By systematically varying the chelating agent structure, chemists can rationally design catalysts for specific reactions rather than relying on trial-and-error optimization.
