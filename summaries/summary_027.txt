This proposition identifies a fundamental tension in secular moral philosophy: rational methods that make ethics intellectually credible may undermine its authority to tell us what we must do. Traditional moral systems derived binding obligations from transcendent sources like divine commands, while secular alternatives based on reason struggle to generate genuine moral requirements rather than sophisticated preferences. Rational critique that makes moral philosophy respectable simultaneously drains it of the categorical force that makes moral obligations feel binding regardless of our desires.
