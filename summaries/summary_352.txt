Electrocatalysts for water splitting must efficiently drive both the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, requiring materials that are active, stable, and made from abundant elements. Earth-abundant transition metal oxides, sulfides, and phosphides show promising catalytic activity through engineering their electronic structure and surface properties. Achieving high efficiency at low overpotentials could enable economical hydrogen production from renewable electricity.
