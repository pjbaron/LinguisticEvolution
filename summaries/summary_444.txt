Ancient populations who regularly consumed psychoactive plants may have evolved genetic variations affecting how fast they metabolize these compounds, creating different cultural trajectories. Fast metabolizers developed sophisticated botanical knowledge and ritual equipment for plant preparation, while slow metabolizers innovated alternative consciousness-altering methods like rhythmic practices, breathing techniques, and special architectural spaces. Testing this theory requires comparing ancient DNA for metabolic genes with archaeological evidence of ritual technologies.
