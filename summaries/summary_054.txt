This proposition argues that cerebral blood flow directly determines cognitive performance through a dose-dependent relationship, with executive functions showing greatest vulnerability to reduced oxygen delivery. Since cognitive impairments reverse when blood flow normalizes, enhancing cerebral perfusion may be more effective than neurotransmitter-based interventions because it addresses the metabolic foundation of neural computation rather than merely adjusting chemical signals within oxygen-starved tissue. For both clinical populations and healthy individuals seeking cognitive enhancement, cardiovascular fitness and circulation-promoting practices offer a direct pathway to improved mental performance.
