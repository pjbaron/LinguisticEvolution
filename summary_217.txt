Languages with grammatical gender systems (like Spanish or German) force speakers to categorize nouns as masculine or feminine even when talking about inanimate objects, which influences how speakers conceptualize those objects. Speakers of gendered languages unconsciously associate gendered objects with stereotypically masculine or feminine traits, while speakers of non-gendered languages (like English or Mandarin) show less of this association. This suggests that grammatical structures actively shape thought processes beyond just providing tools for expression—the language we speak can influence how we perceive and categorize the world.
