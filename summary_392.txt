Sodium-ion batteries offer potential low-cost alternatives to lithium-ion batteries using earth-abundant sodium instead of limited lithium resources. Challenges include larger ionic radius affecting electrode materials and energy density. Developing suitable electrode materials and electrolytes that accommodate sodium's properties while achieving competitive performance could enable sustainable large-scale energy storage.
