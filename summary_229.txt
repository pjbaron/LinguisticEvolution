Language development in children follows predictable stages, but children learning sign language reach linguistic milestones at the same ages as children learning spoken language, even though the modality is completely different. This parallel development suggests that the human brain has an innate language capacity that operates independently of whether language is expressed through sound or gesture. The finding supports the idea that language is a distinct cognitive module rather than a general-purpose learning ability.
