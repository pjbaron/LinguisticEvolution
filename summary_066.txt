This proposition describes how individuals experiencing chronic interpersonal rejection develop defensive compartmentalization of social interactions into brief, controlled segments. This mechanism serves to maintain perceived control while minimizing emotional vulnerability, but creates a self-defeating paradox where shallow interactions fail to satisfy belonging needs and elicit lukewarm responses reinforcing original rejection fears. The compartmentalization fragments social identity itself as individuals lose connection with authentic emotional responses through practiced impression management across segmented interactions.
