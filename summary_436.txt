Metamaterials are engineered structures with properties not found in natural materials, determined by structure rather than composition. Examples include negative refractive index materials enabling superlenses and acoustic metamaterials for sound manipulation. Designing subwavelength structures that interact with electromagnetic or acoustic waves in prescribed ways enables unprecedented control over wave propagation.
