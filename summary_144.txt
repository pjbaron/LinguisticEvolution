This proposition argues that traditional epistemology's emphasis on explicit justification fails to capture how knowledge actually operates in specialized domains where expert practitioners develop reliable knowledge through embodied practice and tacit pattern recognition that cannot be fully articulated propositionally. A master craftsman knows when a joint will hold not by consciously applying engineering principles but through accumulated sensorimotor experience generating immediate reliable judgments. This tacit dimension reveals fundamental limitations in foundationalist and coherentist frameworks which privilege articulable reasons and logical relationships between beliefs.
