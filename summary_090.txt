This proposition argues that consciousness escapes linguistic determinism through embodied temporality—the body's pre-reflective engagement with the world generating meaning before conceptual articulation. Following Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger, the body operates as a meaning-making organ through proprioceptive awareness and affective attunement processing semantic information largely inaccessible to discursive thought. This embodied temporal engagement creates "somatic surplus"—meaning emerging from the body's temporal engagement resisting capture in linguistic structures, grounding human agency in corporeal existence maintaining interpretive freedom against reductive closure.
