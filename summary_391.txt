Seismic waves propagating through Earth reveal internal structure through variations in wave velocities and reflections at boundaries between different layers. Techniques like seismic tomography create three-dimensional images of Earth's interior, revealing features like subducting slabs, mantle plumes, and core composition. These insights are fundamental for understanding plate tectonics, mantle convection, and Earth's thermal evolution.
