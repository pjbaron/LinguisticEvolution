Plate tectonic processes create distinctive patterns of earthquake distribution, volcanic activity, and mountain building that reveal how Earth's lithosphere is organized and evolving. By integrating seismic data, GPS measurements of surface deformation, and geological observations, scientists can map plate boundaries with increasing precision and understand the forces driving plate motion. This knowledge is essential for earthquake hazard assessment and understanding long-term geological evolution.
