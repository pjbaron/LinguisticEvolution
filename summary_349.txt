Neuroplasticity—the brain's ability to reorganize by forming new neural connections—continues throughout life but decreases with age and varies across brain regions. Experience-dependent plasticity enables learning and recovery from injury, with enriched environments and targeted training promoting beneficial neural reorganization. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating plasticity could enable therapeutic interventions to enhance learning, treat neurological disorders, and promote recovery from brain damage.
