Neuroimaging reveals that individuals with protein-related phobias exhibit hyperactivation in the angular gyrus when viewing protein structures, demonstrating that phobic responses recruit visuospatial processing networks beyond traditional fear circuits. This cross-network recruitment explains paradoxical hypervigilance where individuals simultaneously avoid yet obsessively scrutinize feared stimuli. Effective interventions should target both fear extinction and visuospatial processing dysfunction through combined exposure therapy and perceptual retraining.
