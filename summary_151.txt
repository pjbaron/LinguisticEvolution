This proposition argues that traditional agricultural systems reveal fundamental truth: treating livestock as collaborative partners rather than production units creates more sustainable and economically viable farming practices. Historical evidence shows farmers aligning practices with cattle's natural behaviors, social structures, and seasonal cycles achieved both consistent productivity and animal welfare as mutually reinforcing goals. Modern industrial agriculture's abandonment of these reciprocal relationships has generated cascade of problems including environmental degradation, antibiotic resistance, and soil depletion, revealing true inefficiency of exploitation-based models.
