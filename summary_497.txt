Early digitization of legislative texts in specialized formats like EBCDIC created democratic exclusion by making public information accessible only to those with technical expertise. When legal texts become practically inaccessible to ordinary citizens, the fundamental democratic principle that laws derive legitimacy from public consent is undermined. Democratic societies must treat decisions about public information architecture as inherently political choices requiring democratic oversight.
