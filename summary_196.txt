This proposition describes how dendritic microstructures in bigarreau chalcedony form exclusively above 280°C through rapid cooling and supersaturation of silica-rich hydrothermal fluids, providing robust paleothermometer for hydrothermal systems. This temperature threshold represents critical kinetic transition where branching crystal growth patterns develop under specific thermal conditions creating textures exceptionally well-preserved due to chalcedony's chemical stability. The 280°C boundary effectively distinguishes epithermal from mesothermal hydrothermal environments correlating with fundamental changes in metal associations and gangue mineralogy.
