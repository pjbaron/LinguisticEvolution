## Methodology Notes

**Evaluation Approach**:
- Each proposition independently evaluated
- Weighted scoring emphasizes novelty (×8) and testability (×4)
- Domain-appropriate assessment
- Single evaluator (consistent but potential bias)

**Limitations**:
- Brief evaluation time per proposition
- Some propositions incomplete (ended mid-sentence)
- Limited deep expertise across all 20+ domains
- Scores approximate (±5-10 points reasonable uncertainty)

**Confidence**: High confidence in relative rankings and general patterns; specific scores are approximate indicators rather than absolute measures.

**Total Evaluation**: **200 propositions** across **20 batches** spanning **20+ academic domains**

**Overall Grade**: **B+ to A-** (63% average, 41% excellent or outstanding)

The corpus demonstrates competent to excellent scientific and philosophical thinking, with standout contributions in physics, neuroscience, and earth sciences, while philosophical propositions would benefit from greater empirical grounding.
