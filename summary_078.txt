This proposition describes how fluorite crystals from Mesozoic contact metamorphic aureoles contain carbonate inclusions that decarbonate at remarkably consistent 847°C during thermal analysis regardless of geographic location. This uniform temperature indicates formation under similar pressure-temperature conditions and corresponds to calcite-fluorite stability boundaries at 2-4 kbar, suggesting formation depths of 7-15 km and similar intrusion depths across Mesozoic contact systems. The preservation demonstrates rapid post-peak cooling preventing complete decarbonation, indicating contact aureoles experienced brief thermal pulses rather than prolonged heating.
