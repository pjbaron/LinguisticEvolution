This proposes that quantum effects combined with gravity's warping of spacetime could make light travel at slightly different speeds depending on its energy. High-energy light traveling across the universe might arrive at slightly different times than predicted. We could test this by precisely measuring when gamma rays from distant explosions arrive at Earth.
