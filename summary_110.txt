This proposition describes a memory allocation algorithm maintaining spatial locality by treating memory protection boundaries as routing obstacles rather than fragmentation points. When linear allocation encounters a protected region, the allocator creates contiguous paths circumventing restrictions while preserving logical adjacency for applications, clustering related addresses within same page ranges reducing translation lookaside buffer pressure. This routing strategy proves particularly effective for multi-threaded applications sharing large data structures, minimizing virtual-to-physical address translation overhead while maintaining strict memory isolation between threads.
