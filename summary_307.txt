When governments first digitized legislative texts, they used specialized computer formats (like EBCDIC) that required technical expertise to access, unintentionally excluding ordinary citizens from public information. This created a new form of democratic inequality where technical complexity rather than explicit barriers determined who could meaningfully participate in civic life. Societies must recognize that technical decisions about public information systems are actually political choices about democratic inclusion that require public oversight.
