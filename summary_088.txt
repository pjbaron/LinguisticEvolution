This proposition identifies fundamental limitations in platinum-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation through dual mechanisms simultaneously degrading activity and selectivity for sterically demanding substrates. Activity loss occurs through disrupted binding geometries where bulky substrates cannot achieve optimal coordination, while selectivity degradation proves more severe as steric congestion disrupts precise spatial arrangement between substrate faces and chiral ligands. These limitations reflect platinum's inherent structural rigidity, as mandatory square-planar geometry creates inflexible spatial requirements resisting modification through ligand engineering.
