Memory consolidation is the process of transferring information from short-term to long-term storage, and it requires specific brain wave patterns during sleep. Nootropic compounds that enhance this consolidation work by supporting the neural oscillation patterns (especially theta and gamma wave coupling) that the hippocampus uses to move memories to long-term storage in the cortex. This targeted approach could improve memory retention without the side effects of general stimulants, particularly for people with memory disorders or age-related cognitive decline.
