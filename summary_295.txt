Formal logical systems face a fundamental paradox: the pursuit of rigorous precision necessarily creates dependency on external interpretive frameworks, undermining the autonomy that formalization seeks. Systems' symbols acquire meaning only through external interpretation beyond the system's boundaries, creating an inverse relationship between formal rigor and interpretive independence. Our most precise logical systems require the most extensive external semantic scaffolding and cannot validate their own interpretations from within their formal structure.
