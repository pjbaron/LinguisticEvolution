Working memory capacity—the ability to hold and manipulate information temporarily—shows significant individual variation and correlates with fluid intelligence and academic achievement. This capacity appears limited by both storage constraints and interference from irrelevant information, with training potentially improving performance through better filtering strategies. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying these limitations could inform interventions for attention and learning difficulties.
