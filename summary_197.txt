This proposition argues that chrome surfaces in modern technology create phenomenological barrier to authentic encounter with Being where their infinite recursive reflections trap consciousness in hall of mirrors where each surface refers only to other surfaces never reaching underlying essence. This technological privileging of reflective materials transforms our environment into realm where fundamental ontological questions become inaccessible, as chrome doesn't merely obscure Being but systematically replaces direct existential encounter with mediated experience substituting authentic presence with endless self-referential reflection.
