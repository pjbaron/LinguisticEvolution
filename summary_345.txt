Language death occurs when the last speakers of a language pass away without transmitting it to new generations, resulting in permanent loss of unique linguistic and cultural knowledge. Factors driving language endangerment include political suppression, economic pressure to adopt dominant languages, and intergenerational transmission failure. Language revitalization efforts require community commitment, institutional support, and careful documentation to preserve linguistic diversity before it's irretrievably lost.
