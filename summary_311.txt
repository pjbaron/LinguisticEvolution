Ancient organisms that once dominated Earth's ecosystems left behind chemical signatures in rocks that can reveal information about past climates, oxygen levels, and major extinction events. By analyzing specific molecular fossils (biomarkers) and isotope ratios in sedimentary rocks, scientists can reconstruct ancient environmental conditions and understand how life responded to planetary-scale changes. These geochemical time capsules provide windows into Earth's history that complement traditional fossils and help predict how modern ecosystems might respond to current climate change.
