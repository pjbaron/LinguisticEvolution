This proposition describes how Population III stars created heavy elements through stellar winds and supernovae, with these primordial chemical signatures potentially surviving today in the circumgalactic medium of massive elliptical galaxies where slow gas mixing over cosmic time has preserved abundance patterns. The diagnostic signature would be extreme alpha-enhancement relative to iron at very low metallicities—abundance ratios unachievable through any subsequent stellar processes. Detection would constrain fundamental unknowns about the first stars including metallicity floor revealing early metal dispersal efficiency and alpha-to-iron ratios distinguishing between competing mass function models.
