Pidgin languages emerge when communities with no common language need to communicate, developing simplified grammar and mixed vocabulary from source languages. When children learn pidgins as native languages, they undergo creolization—rapid complexification into full natural languages with complete grammatical systems. This process reveals how much linguistic structure children instinctively impose, suggesting innate language capacity that goes beyond the input they receive.
