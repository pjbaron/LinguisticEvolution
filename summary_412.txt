Aluminum-ion batteries potentially offer low cost and high safety using abundant aluminum, but face challenges including suitable cathode materials and compatible electrolytes. Aluminum's trivalent charge enables high theoretical capacity but complicates finding materials that reversibly intercalate Al³⁺ ions. Developing appropriate electrode chemistries could enable viable aluminum-based energy storage.
