This proposition suggests that magnetized filamentary structures in the cosmic web play a more fundamental role in cosmic architecture than standard models predict. These magnetic filaments extending across megaparsec scales through cosmic voids create persistent conduits channeling baryonic matter between dark matter halos, indicating cosmic structure formation involves coupled gravitational-electromagnetic dynamics. This framework addresses observational puzzles including the deficit of baryons in galaxy halos and surprisingly uniform metallicity distribution in the intergalactic medium by providing mechanisms for continuous matter transport and mixing.
