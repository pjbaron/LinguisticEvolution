This proposition describes how the Operantis Formation contains closely-spaced planar deformation structures within sedimentary layers that function as paleoseismic indicators. These structures formed through cyclic seismic loading, with systematic orientation reflecting ancient stress field directions and spacing correlating with proximity to seismic sources. Rapid post-deformation burial created exceptional preservation, making these features valuable for reconstructing ancient seismic activity and providing temporal constraints for major deformation episodes extending far beyond instrumental records.
