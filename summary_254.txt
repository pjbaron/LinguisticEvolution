The Wayne cultural complex of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica developed specialized ceremonial spaces called "dismals" that transformed individual grief into collective ritual performances that reinforced social hierarchies. By channeling the emotional vulnerability of bereavement into structured communal ritual, the Wayne complex converted potentially destabilizing grief into opportunities for reaffirming political authority. The system made social inequality appear as natural and divinely ordained as mortality itself, creating social control that participants experienced as sacred obligation.
