This proposition examines how adding chemically stable rare earth elements (like lanthanides) to volcanic glass transforms it into extremely durable materials that can survive for geological timescales. The rare earth elements integrate into the glass structure at the molecular level, creating internal chemical barriers that prevent water and other reactive molecules from breaking down the glass over time. This approach could create ultra-stable materials for applications requiring extreme longevity, such as nuclear waste storage or long-term data preservation.
