Entangled photon pairs in free space demonstrate unexpectedly robust coherence over extended distances, suggesting vacuum fluctuations may constructively interact with quantum states to suppress decoherence. Orbital environments offer pure vacuum conditions while eliminating atmospheric interference, making space-based quantum networks potentially superior to fiber infrastructure. The vacuum itself becomes an enabling technology rather than obstacle for quantum communication.
