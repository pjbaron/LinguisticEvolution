This proposition describes how archaeal DNA replication machinery exhibits reduced processivity when clamp loader complexes encounter methylated CpG sequences, demonstrating direct epigenetic regulatory mechanism operating independently of chromatin remodeling. This methylation-dependent control represents mechanistically simpler pathway for epigenetic inheritance than eukaryotic systems where methylation primarily affects transcription through chromatin modifications. The discovery challenges assumption that epigenetic mechanisms are exclusive to eukaryotes and suggests capacity for heritable gene regulation without DNA sequence changes represents fundamental biological strategy predating complex cellular organization.
