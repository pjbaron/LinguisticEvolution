This proposition describes how metamaterial substrates with logarithmic spiral geometries create spatially modulated electromagnetic fields extending electron spin coherence times through geometric rather than chemical means. The spiral's self-similar scaling properties generate hierarchical electromagnetic potential landscapes simultaneously confining spin states and reducing coupling to decoherence sources, creating nested regions where field gradients establish effective potential barriers. Unlike conventional approaches relying on material purity or cryogenic cooling, this geometric protection mechanism exploits structural symmetries to suppress environmental noise coupling.
