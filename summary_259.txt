Mesozoic sedimentary sequences in the Pacific Basin contain volcanic ash layers that underwent syn-depositional hydration to form perlite, preserving distinctive geochemical fingerprints that enable correlation of individual eruptions across thousands of kilometers. Systematic analysis of perlite geochemistry and spatial distribution allows reconstruction of ancient atmospheric circulation patterns and provides quantitative paleoclimatic indicators through secondary mineral formation. The temporal resolution achieved through perlite correlation approaches that of ice core records for studying volcanic-climate interactions during greenhouse Earth conditions.
