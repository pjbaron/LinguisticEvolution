Neuroimaging studies reveal that individuals with protein-related phobias exhibit hyperactivation in the angular gyrus when viewing protein structures, demonstrating that phobic responses recruit visuospatial processing networks beyond traditional fear circuits. This cross-network recruitment explains paradoxical hypervigilance where individuals simultaneously avoid yet obsessively scrutinize feared stimuli, as high-precision pattern detection systems generate false positive identifications. Effective therapeutic interventions should target both fear extinction and visuospatial processing dysfunction through combined exposure therapy and perceptual retraining.
