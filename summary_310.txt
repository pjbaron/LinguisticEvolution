Consciousness serves as the fundamental bridge between raw existence and structured experience, actively organizing undifferentiated reality into the coherent phenomena we perceive. Rather than just receiving pre-formed objects from the world, consciousness performs a kind of "translation" that makes reality accessible to experience while preserving something essential that remains beyond reach. Consciousness exists not as a thing but as the dynamic relationship itself—the ongoing process through which being reveals itself in experience.
