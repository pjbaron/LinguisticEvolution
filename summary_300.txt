Consciousness operates as the fundamental mediator between being-in-itself and experiential manifestation, actively constituting structured phenomena from undifferentiated reality. Rather than passively receiving objects, consciousness performs ontological translation—rendering the inherently inaccessible accessible while preserving being's essential mystery. Consciousness exists as pure relationality rather than substantial entity, constituting the dynamic interface where being becomes appearance without reducing to representation.
