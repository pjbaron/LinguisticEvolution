This proposition describes how communities championing commercially unsuccessful or institutionally neglected art develop fundamentally different relationship to culture than those organized around pre-validated works. When members collectively recognize overlooked merit, they forge bonds through shared aesthetic discovery rather than inherited cultural hierarchies, demonstrating artistic value operates independently of market validation. This collaborative discovery creates distinct cultural meaning where aesthetic judgment becomes genuinely collective as members must articulate and defend perceptions through participatory discourse strengthening both individual discernment and group cohesion.
