This proposition describes how fluid flow stability in honeycomb-structured porous media is governed by non-self-adjoint operators defined on fractal domains, with complex eigenvalue spectrum encoding critical flow characteristics where real components determine stability thresholds and imaginary components reveal characteristic frequencies. The fractal dimension of pore boundary geometry directly controls spectral gap magnitude through scaling relationships, enabling precise engineering of honeycomb microstructures by selecting specific fractal dimensions to suppress instabilities in laminar flow or promote controlled instabilities for enhanced mixing.
