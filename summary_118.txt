This proposition describes how saussuritization of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions in carbonaceous chondrites, combined with presolar grain preservation patterns, establishes novel chronometer for early Solar System aqueous alteration. The degree of alteration inversely correlates with presolar grain abundance as presolar grains are preferentially destroyed during hydrothermal processes while refractory minerals persist, revealing extensive parent body alteration began 2-3 million years after inclusion formation and proceeded rapidly. This chronometric relationship requires fundamental revision of planetesimal evolution timescales indicating significant aqueous alteration occurred much earlier than previously recognized.
