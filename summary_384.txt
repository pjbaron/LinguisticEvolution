Meta-learning or "learning to learn" trains models to quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal data by learning good initialization points, optimization strategies, or model architectures. This mimics how humans leverage past experience to rapidly learn new skills. Applications include few-shot learning, rapid adaptation in robotics, and personalized systems that quickly customize to individual users.
