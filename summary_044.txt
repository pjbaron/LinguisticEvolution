This proposition describes how the Cassabully Formation reveals systematic relationships between marine transgressions and hydrothermal alteration that controlled reservoir quality evolution. During rapid sea-level rise, increased sediment loading generated overpressure that drove fluid expulsion along structural weaknesses, creating enhanced permeability networks at predictable stratigraphic positions. Since these hydrothermal zones occur systematically within transgressive systems tracts, mapping transgressive surfaces provides a framework for predicting high-permeability conduits in time-equivalent formations.
