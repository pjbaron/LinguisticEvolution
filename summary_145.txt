This proposition describes how convergence behavior of iterative tensor factorization algorithms is fundamentally determined by the spectral gap between largest and second-largest singular values. When this ratio is large, algorithms achieve exponential convergence requiring only logarithmic iterations for accuracy, but as the gap approaches unity, convergence degrades to linear or sublinear rates demanding many more iterations. This spectral conditioning becomes increasingly severe in high-dimensional settings where curse of dimensionality naturally concentrates singular value spectra, creating convergence plateaus where algorithms oscillate between suboptimal subspaces without global progress.
