Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous crystalline materials built from organic molecules linked by strong covalent bonds, creating precisely defined nanoscale channels and cavities. By selecting building blocks with specific shapes and functional groups, chemists can rationally design COFs with tailored pore sizes, chemical environments, and electronic properties. These designer materials show promise for applications including gas storage, catalysis, sensing, and optoelectronics.
