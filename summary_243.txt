Revolutionary movements contain a fundamental contradiction: the institutional power needed to secure revolutionary change systematically undermines the emancipatory goals that justified the revolution. Governing requires building hierarchical structures, enforcing ideology, and suppressing dissent—measures that become permanent features rather than temporary protections. Sustainable emancipation may require abandoning the revolutionary seizure model entirely in favor of building parallel alternative structures that make existing power increasingly obsolete.
