Certain minerals form distinctive crystal structures in the presence of biological organisms that are different from those formed purely through geological processes, creating potential biosignatures. These biologically-influenced minerals preserve microscopic textures and chemical patterns that can survive for billions of years, offering a way to detect ancient or extraterrestrial life. By cataloging the specific crystallographic signatures associated with biological activity, scientists can develop tools for recognizing life's influence in ancient rocks and potentially in samples from other planets.
