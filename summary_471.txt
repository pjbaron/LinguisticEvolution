Early geological surveys of the Appalachian mountains overlooked microcrystalline minerals due to analytical limitations, creating gaps in understanding metamorphic and ore-forming processes. Microcrystalline phases preserve the most detailed records of conditions because they form early before later processes obscure the signatures. Modern analytical techniques can now extract precise geochemical and temporal data from these microscale materials, potentially revealing new insights into mountain-building processes.
