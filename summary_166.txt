This proposition describes how muscle contraction depends on myosin ATPase cycling through distinct conformational states persisting microseconds to milliseconds, with therapeutic compounds potentially selectively stabilizing specific conformational intermediates shifting enzyme equilibrium toward particular catalytic states to modulate contractile kinetics without complete inhibition. This conformational targeting strategy addresses critical limitations in treating muscle disorders where complete enzyme blockade is counterproductive, with pre-power stroke and post-power stroke states representing optimal targets exhibiting distinct actin-binding interfaces and nucleotide pocket geometries.
