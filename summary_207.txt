Democratic legitimacy depends on four foundations: popular sovereignty, constitutional constraint, deliberative rationality, and procedural fairness, all of which assume that people share basic methods for determining truth and evaluating evidence. When political communities develop incompatible ways of knowing what's true (epistemic polarization), these foundations begin to undermine each other rather than support democracy. Unlike ideological disagreements about values, which can strengthen democracy through debate, incompatible epistemologies make democratic debate impossible because people can't agree on how to determine truth itself.
