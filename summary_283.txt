When deliberative assemblies systematically exclude marginalized voices through procedural barriers, informal networks, and discursive norms, they create institutional facades that simulate democratic legitimacy while concentrating power. These exclusionary practices become self-reinforcing as those who benefit acquire greater capacity to shape rules perpetuating their advantage. Meaningful inclusion requires dismantling interconnected barriers that systematically advantage some voices while silencing others, going beyond procedural reforms to address substantive capacity to influence decisions.
