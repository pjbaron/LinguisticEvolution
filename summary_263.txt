Modal operators reveal a fundamental asymmetry between abstract and concrete objects that undermines classical modal logic's universal applicability—mathematical propositions preserve truth values under modal transformation while empirical propositions yield false or incoherent results. This asymmetry exposes that modal operators presuppose context-independence, but spatiotemporal entities possess inherently indexical properties tied to particular times, places, and causal histories. Rigorous modal reasoning about empirical phenomena requires either domain-restricted systems or context-sensitive frameworks that incorporate spatiotemporal parameters.
