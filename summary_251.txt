Market downturns create conditions for permanent shifts toward oligopolistic market structures through a predictable three-phase mechanism where financially strong firms exploit capital market access advantages to acquire distressed competitors at discounts. The critical vulnerability occurs during early recovery when regulatory focus remains on macroeconomic stabilization rather than market structure, creating a window where market leaders can reshape industries before competition normalizes. This pro-cyclical nature of antitrust enforcement systematically favors market concentration over time.
