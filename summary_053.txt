This proposition describes how environmental crises are restructuring professional authority by privileging demonstrated competence over institutional credentials. When bismite contamination threatened coastal aquaculture, practitioners formed transnational networks that bypassed traditional regulatory channels, validating expertise through proven problem-solving capacity rather than formal hierarchies or academic pedigrees. This transformation reflects a shift toward performance-based legitimacy where authority flows to those who demonstrate practical effectiveness, creating dual governance systems where informal expert networks operate alongside formal institutional structures.
