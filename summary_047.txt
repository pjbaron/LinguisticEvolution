This proposition identifies how legacy codebases develop circular dependency patterns creating memory leaks through two mechanisms: structural cycles in object hierarchies and architectural cycles in event-driven systems. While modern garbage collectors handle simple cycles, they fail when entire cyclic structures become unreachable from application roots while maintaining internal references, creating "dead zones" that persist throughout application lifecycle. The fundamental issue is that garbage collectors operate on local reachability within single processes, but modern applications create reference graphs spanning processes and services.
