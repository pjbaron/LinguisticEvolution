Hierarchical dependency relationships in distributed systems create computational bottlenecks that cascade through dependency chains, but a four-node architecture addresses this by breaking dependency chains at node boundaries. This configuration provides quantifiable fault tolerance where any single node failure affects at most 25% of capacity while enabling practical Byzantine fault tolerance and primary-backup replication pairs. Four nodes represent an architectural sweet spot balancing redundancy with operational complexity while keeping network communication patterns efficient.
