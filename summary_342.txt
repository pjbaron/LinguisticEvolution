Photocatalytic materials use light energy to drive chemical reactions like water splitting or CO2 reduction, potentially enabling sustainable fuel production. Efficiency depends on the material's ability to absorb sunlight, separate photo-generated charges, and catalyze target reactions at its surface. Optimizing these competing requirements through material design (bandgap engineering, surface modifications, co-catalysts) could enable economically viable solar fuel technologies.
