Palomino coat color results from elongated dermal papilla structures in hair follicles that create spatially distinct microenvironments, producing selective suppression of dark pigment while maintaining golden pigment in specific follicular regions. This contrasts with uniform dilution mechanisms and depends critically on the timing of papilla elongation relative to pigment cell migration. The developmental framework likely extends to other selective dilution phenotypes and suggests that follicular architecture serves as a critical module for amplifying phenotypic diversity.
