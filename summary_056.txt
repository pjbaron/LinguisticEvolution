This proposition describes how cathin disrupts modal reasoning by selectively impairing neurochemical processes maintaining epistemic coherence across knowledge levels. Under cathin's influence, an agent may know something while losing access to their knowledge that they know it, because cathin interferes with recursive application of epistemic operators. This reveals that modal reasoning requires specific neurochemical substrates rather than purely formal mechanisms, providing an empirical method for investigating which logical capacities are biologically unified and which can be independently compromised.
