Grain size controls fault zone architecture by governing strain accommodation—fine-grained rocks localize shear generating systematically oriented fractures with high connectivity, while coarse-grained rocks distribute strain producing scattered fractures. Fine-grained zones develop high-permeability conduits and promote strain localization through positive feedback, while coarse-grained domains resist continuous fracture development. Grain size mapping provides predictive frameworks for fault permeability and mechanical behavior.
