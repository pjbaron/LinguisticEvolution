Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with regular pore structures that act as molecular sieves, selectively allowing molecules below certain size cutoffs to enter. Their applications span catalysis, gas separation, and ion exchange, with performance depending on pore size, shape, and chemical environment. Synthesizing zeolites with specific topologies and compositions enables designer materials for targeted applications.
