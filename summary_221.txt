Artists working with natural materials like wood or stone develop deep knowledge of those materials' properties through hands-on experience, which shapes the artistic choices they can make. This embodied material understanding differs fundamentally from theoretical knowledge—a sculptor learns through touch and resistance what wood will do under different conditions, information that can't be fully captured in words. The proposition suggests that the material itself becomes a collaborator in the creative process, with its properties guiding and constraining artistic possibilities.
