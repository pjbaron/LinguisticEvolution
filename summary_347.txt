Prehistoric art found in caves worldwide often depicts similar motifs (animals, handprints, geometric patterns) and utilizes similar techniques despite geographic and temporal separation. These commonalities may reflect universal features of human cognition and symbolic thinking that emerged with our species, or they may result from shared cultural transmission within connected populations. Distinguishing between these explanations requires integrating archaeological, genetic, and cognitive evidence.
