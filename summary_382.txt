Redox flow batteries store energy in liquid electrolytes containing dissolved redox-active species, with capacity determined by electrolyte volume and power by electrode area. This decoupling of energy and power enables flexible system design for grid-scale storage. Developing high-performance flow batteries requires electrolytes with high solubility, stability, and reversibility, plus membranes preventing crossover while conducting ions.
