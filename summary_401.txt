Isotope geochemistry uses variations in isotopic ratios to trace processes like magma genesis, crustal evolution, and fluid-rock interactions. Different isotopic systems (radiogenic, stable, cosmogenic) provide complementary information about ages, sources, and conditions. Advanced mass spectrometry enables increasingly precise measurements revealing Earth's history and dynamics.
