This proposition describes how contemporary fiber art installations exploit human perception's inability to maintain sensory boundaries when confronted with convincing material textures. Dense, thread-like surfaces trigger "haptic hallucination" where viewers experience phantom sensations while standing meters from the work, as fiber appears simultaneously substantial and ephemeral. This phenomenon dissolves traditional aesthetic distance by having implied texture infiltrate surrounding space through visual suggestion alone, revealing that the nervous system cannot reliably distinguish between actual and implied texture when confronted with sufficiently convincing visual information.
