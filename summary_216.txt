This proposition explores how different types of microscopic ocean organisms respond to changes in water temperature and acidity, creating shifts in which species dominate the plankton community. These compositional changes alter the efficiency of the biological pump (the process that moves carbon from the ocean surface to the deep ocean), affecting how much atmospheric CO2 the ocean can absorb. By studying sediment cores that preserve ancient plankton communities, scientists can understand how past warming events affected ocean carbon cycling and predict how future climate change might alter the ocean's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide.
