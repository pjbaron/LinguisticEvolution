For self-adjoint operators on infinite-dimensional spaces, compact perturbations leave the essential spectrum completely invariant while allowing arbitrary modification of discrete eigenvalues. This enables systematic spectral engineering where you can reposition, create, or eliminate discrete eigenvalues to optimize transient behavior and resonance structures while preserving the continuous dynamics that define the system's essential character. The rigidity-plasticity dichotomy reveals a fundamental structural principle about how "bulk" and "isolated" spectral behaviors decouple in infinite dimensions.
