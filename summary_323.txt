Political polarization appears to be driven not just by disagreements about policy but by fundamental differences in moral psychology—conservatives and liberals prioritize different moral foundations like fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity. These deep moral differences make political compromise difficult because what appears as a practical policy question to one side feels like a moral violation to the other. Understanding these underlying moral frameworks could help bridge political divides by revealing the legitimate values motivating both sides rather than attributing disagreement to ignorance or malice.
