This proposition argues that mycological research exhibits epistemic injustice by dismissing indigenous knowledge as "anecdotal" while treating Western taxonomic methods as uniquely objective. Indigenous communities have developed sophisticated frameworks understanding fungal ecology across generations, with nomenclature encoding precise ecological information about relationships, temporal dynamics, and functional properties that Western morphology-based classification fragments. Meaningful reform requires treating indigenous knowledge holders as epistemic equals through collaborative methodologies accommodating multiple knowledge systems without forcing translation into Western categories.
