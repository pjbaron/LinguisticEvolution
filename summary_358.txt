Asymmetric catalysis produces chiral molecules with specific three-dimensional arrangements (handedness) essential for pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. Designing catalysts that favor one chiral form over its mirror image requires precise control of the catalyst's stereochemical environment through chiral ligands or frameworks. Achieving high enantioselectivity (preferential production of one enantiomer) enables efficient synthesis of optically pure compounds.
