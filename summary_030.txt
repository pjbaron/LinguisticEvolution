This proposition identifies a fundamental limitation in distributed hash tables: while they effectively distribute data storage across nodes, they don't distribute computational work. Each node must independently execute full algorithmic operations like searches or cryptographic computations, creating bottlenecks where performance degrades to the speed of the slowest node. This architectural gap means DHTs succeed as distributed storage but fail as distributed computing platforms, requiring hybrid architectures that layer computational frameworks over DHT-based storage.
