English compound words containing "rubble" demonstrate that sound reduction in technical vocabulary depends on morphological transparency—compositionally clear compounds resist consonant deletion while lexicalized terms undergo simplification. This reveals that speakers preserve word structure when compound meaning remains transparent but allow sound optimization when compounds become semantically opaque. Technical vocabulary undergoes systematic sound change along a pathway from compositional transparency to lexicalized opacity.
