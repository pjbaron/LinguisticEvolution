Gerrymandering manipulates electoral district boundaries to advantage particular parties or groups, undermining democratic representation by allowing politicians to choose voters rather than vice versa. Techniques include packing opposition voters into few districts and cracking them across many districts to dilute their influence. Remedies include independent redistricting commissions, algorithmic fairness criteria, and judicial oversight, though defining fair districts remains contentious.
