Social media platforms use algorithmic curation to maximize user engagement, but these algorithms often amplify emotionally charged and divisive content because it generates more clicks and shares. This creates a feedback loop where extreme content receives more visibility, which incentivizes creating more extreme content, progressively polarizing public discourse. Reforming these systems requires changing the optimization target from engagement metrics to healthier measures of information quality and social cohesion.
