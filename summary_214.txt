This proposition addresses how quantum computers can be programmed to maximize the probability of getting correct answers while minimizing errors, which is critical since quantum systems are extremely fragile and prone to mistakes. The approach uses variational quantum algorithms that iteratively adjust quantum operations based on feedback, combined with error mitigation strategies that identify and compensate for noise patterns. By optimizing both the quantum circuit design and error correction simultaneously, this method could make near-term quantum computers practically useful despite their imperfections.
