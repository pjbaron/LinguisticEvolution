The decline of interfaith dialogue in pluralistic democracies creates structural vulnerability that political elites exploit to capture religious communities as partisan instruments, undermining both democratic accountability and religious independence. When religious traditions retreat into isolation, political actors exploit divisions to manufacture reliable voting blocs, reducing complex theological worldviews to crude electoral calculations. Breaking this cycle requires recognizing interfaith dialogue as essential democratic infrastructure that preserves space for authentic religious witness.
