In emerging markets, storage facility operators possess real-time inventory data while buyers and sellers don't, creating an information advantage they can exploit for price manipulation. This information monopoly enables operators to signal artificial scarcity to inflate prices while hiding supply buffers, and to time inventory releases strategically to maximize their own profits. Without mandatory inventory reporting or independent verification mechanisms, these operators extract economic rents by manipulating what should be transparent commodity markets.
