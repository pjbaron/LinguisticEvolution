Earth's magnetic field, generated by convection in the liquid outer core, shields the planet from solar radiation and cosmic rays. The field's intensity and orientation vary over time, with periodic reversals where north and south magnetic poles flip. Understanding geomagnetic dynamics through paleomagnetic records, observations, and modeling illuminates core processes and helps assess potential impacts of field variations on climate and technology.
