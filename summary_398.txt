Organometallic chemistry combines organic chemistry with metal catalysis, enabling transformations difficult or impossible with purely organic reagents. Metal complexes can activate strong bonds, control stereochemistry, and facilitate coupling reactions essential for pharmaceutical and materials synthesis. Understanding metal-ligand interactions guides catalyst design for specific transformations.
