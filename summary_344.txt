Reinforcement learning enables agents to learn complex behaviors through trial-and-error interaction with environments, receiving rewards for desired actions. Deep reinforcement learning combines this with neural networks capable of learning from high-dimensional inputs like images, enabling superhuman performance in games and robotic control. Challenges include sample efficiency (requiring many experiences to learn), reward specification (defining what we want), and safe exploration in real-world settings.
