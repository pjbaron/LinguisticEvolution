Catalysts work by lowering the energy barrier for chemical reactions, but their efficiency depends critically on how reactant molecules are oriented when they encounter the catalyst surface. By designing catalyst surfaces with specific geometric features that preferentially bind molecules in productive orientations, chemists can dramatically increase reaction rates and selectivity. This "shape-selective catalysis" enables production of specific molecular products while suppressing unwanted side reactions.
